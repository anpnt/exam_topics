Technically Yes, Correct 

Dual (Composite) Mode:
The dual storage mode is between Import and DirectQuery. it is a hybrid approach, Like importing data, the dual storage mode caches the data in the table. However, it leaves it up to Power BI to determine the best way to query the table depending on the query context.

1) Sales Must be Refreshed in Near real time so "Direct Query"
2) Sales Aggregate is once per week so "Import" (performance also required)
3) Both Date and Customer has relationship with both Sales and SalesAggregate tables so "Dual"
because to support performance for DirectQuery(Sales) and Import(SalesAggregate)
******************************
Highly Voted comment found!
My interpretation of the answer:

there are 2 fact tables connected to 2 dim tables. Sales fact table needs DirectQuery.. Sales  Aggregate table needs to weekly refreshes hence Import mode. But both dimension tables have to serve these fact tables and hence they will be in DUAL MODE. Am I correct?

We have to import Excel files from SharePoint, so we need the connector SharePoint folder which is used to get access to the files stored in the library. SharePoint list is a collection of content that has rows and columns (like a table) and is used for task lists, calendars, etc. 
Since we have to filter only on manufacturing reports, we have to select Transform and then filter by the corresponding folder path.
******************************
Highly Voted comment found!
The Correct Answer is A. 
To load only the manufacturing reports (Microsoft Excel Files) from a specified SharePoint document library into Power BI Desktop for analysis, we should do, Geta data from a SharePoint folder and enter the site URL. Select Transform, then filter by the folder path to the manufacturing reports library. Option B is not the right answer choice because "SharePoint list" is selected, and you need to access files in a document library, not a list. Option C and Option D both include "Combine & Load", which typically combines multiple queries or tables and loads them into Power BI. However, since we only want to load files from a specific folder within the SharePoint library, we should use the "Transform" option to filter and select the desired data before loading it into Power BI.

B. Change the data type of the Logged column to Date.
C. Split the Logged column by using at as the delimiter.

Answer C is best approach
Split the Logged column by using "at" as the delimiter.
******************************
Highly Voted comment found!
C,

You should split the Logged column by using "at" as the delimiter. This will allow you to separate the date and time into separate columns, which will enable you to analyze the complaints by date and use a built-in date hierarchy. Alternatively, you could also use a transformation to extract the date and time from the Logged column and set the data type of the new columns to Date and Time, respectively. Option A is incorrect because it only extracts the last 11 characters of the Logged column, which would not include the date. Option B is incorrect because the data in the Logged column is in a non-standard date format and cannot be directly converted to the Date data type. Option D is incorrect because it only extracts the first 11 characters of the Logged column, which would not include the time.

A business intelligence (BI) developer creates a dataflow in Power BI that uses DirectQuery to access tables from an on-premises Microsoft SQL server. The
Enhanced Dataflows Compute Engine is turned on for the dataflow.
You need to use the dataflow in a report. The solution must meet the following requirements:
✑ Minimize online processing operations.
✑ Minimize calculation times and render times for visuals.
✑ Include data from the current year, up to and including the previous day.
What should you do?
A. Create a dataflows connection that has DirectQuery mode selected.
B. Create a dataflows connection that has DirectQuery mode selected and configure a gateway connection for the dataset.
C. Create a dataflows connection that has Import mode selected and schedule a daily refresh.
D. Create a dataflows connection that has Import mode selected and create a Microsoft Power Automate solution to refresh the data hourly.

Highly Voted comment found!
Correct Answer C

Based on the requirements mentioned, the best option would be to choose option C: Create a dataflows connection that has Import mode selected and schedule a daily refresh.

Option A is not the best choice as it requires online processing operations, which goes against one of the requirements.

Option B is not necessary since the SQL Server is on-premises and not in a cloud environment. Gateway connections are typically used for cloud-based data sources that require access to on-premises data.

Option D refreshes the data too frequently and might lead to unnecessary processing operations, which goes against one of the requirements.

Therefore, the best approach is to use Import mode with daily scheduled refreshes to include data from the current year, up to and including the previous day. This would minimize online processing operations and also reduce calculation times and render times for visuals.

No confusion, and no need to discuss further

Here are the correct three actions should be performed in sequence:
Action 1: Select the Month and MonthNumber Columns. These columns will be used for the slicers to filter the data by month.
Action 2: Select unpivot other columns. This action will transform the 2019, 2020, and 2021 columns into rows, creating a column called "Attribute" that contains the years and a column called "Value" that contains the sales data. This step makes the data more suitable for visualization and filtering by year.
Action 3: Rename the Attribute column as Year and the value column as sales. Renaming the columns provides a more descriptive and meaningful structure for your data.
After performing these actions, your data will be in a format that allows you to create visuals and add slicers for the month and year in Power BI.

Given answer is correct 

To meet the requirements specified, we can use a single parameter in the PBIX file that controls which database is used for data consumption based on the stage of the development lifecycle.

We can use a Text parameter type in Power BI to achieve this. The parameter can be used to switch between the different database connections when a user interacts with the report. The text parameter could include values such as "Development", "Staging", and "Production", which correspond to the different databases shown in the table.

The parameter can then be used in the queries to dynamically filter the data based on the selected stage of the development lifecycle. By using a single parameter, we can minimize administrative effort and ensure that the report works with each stage of the development lifecycle.

Mismatched data types and A1 are the correct answers. The custom column expression is trying to concatenate (use the "&" operator) a text value and a number value, which are mismatched data types. In this case, the left side of the operator is a text value (e.g.,"A"), and the right side is a number value (e.g.,1).
To achieve the desired outcome of the custom column as "A1", you should ensure that both sides of the "&" operator have the same data type, which is text in this case.

Highly Voted comment found!
So, the correct selections would be:
A. You do not have permissions to the file.
D. The referenced file was moved to a new location.

Other options cause another message:

B. If an incorrect privacy level is set for a data source, you might receive an error related to data privacy like: "Formula.Firewall: Query 'QueryName' references other queries or steps, so it may not directly access a data source. Please rebuild this data combination."

C. If a file is locked, for example because it is open in another application and that application has locked the file for exclusive access, the error message might be something like: "DataSource.Error: The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process."

You have data in a Microsoft Excel worksheet as shown in the following table.
https://img.examtopics.com/pl-300/image341.png
You need to use Power Query to clean and transform the dataset. The solution must meet the following requirements:
• If the discount column returns an error, a discount of 0.05 must be used.
• All the rows of data must be maintained.
• Administrative effort must be minimized.
What should you do in Power Query Editor?
A. Select Replace Errors.
B. Edit the query in the Query Errors group.
C. Select Remove Errors.
D. Select Keep Errors.

Highly Voted comment found!
A. Select Replace Errors. is the correct answer. Because selecting "Replace Errors" allows you to replace any errors in the discount column with a specified value, which in the case is 0.05 as per the requirement.
Option B is not necessary for this specific task. Option C would remove rows with errors entirely, which is not in line with the requirement to maintain all rows of data. Option D would keep rows with errors as they are, which is not what we want since we want to replace errors with a specific value.

Report file: Import: In Power BI, when you import data, it means that the data is loaded into the Power BI Desktop file. In this case, you would import the data from both Excel workbooks into your Power BI Desktop report file. This allows you to create visuals and reports based on the imported data. Importing the data ensures that you can work with the data even when you're not connected to OneDrive.

Dataset: DirectQuery: To keep the data in OneDrive and maintain a live connection to the source, you should use DirectQuery for the dataset. DirectQuery allows Power BI to retrieve and query data from the original data source (in this case, the Excel workbooks in OneDrive) in real-time without importing it into the dataset. This ensures that your dataset is always up-to-date and reflects changes made to the source data.

A. Merge queries
B. Combine files
C. Append queries

Highly Voted comment found!
There are two primary ways of combining queries: merging and appending.

For one or more columns that you’d like to add to another query, you merge the queries.
For one or more rows of data that you’d like to add to an existing query, you append the query.

General Overview -
Northwind Traders is a specialty food import company.
The company recently implemented Power BI to better understand its top customers, products, and suppliers.
Business Issues -
The sales department relies on the IT department to generate reports in Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS). The IT department takes too long to generate the reports and often misunderstands the report requirements.
Existing Environment. Data Sources
Northwind Traders uses the data sources shown in the following table.
https://img.examtopics.com/pl-300/image373.png
Source2 is exported daily from a third-party system and stored in Microsoft SharePoint Online.

The Sales Employees table contains the following columns.
https://img.examtopics.com/pl-300/image380.png
Each employee in the Sales Employees table is assigned to one sales region. Multiple employees can be assigned to each region.
Requirements. Report Requirements
Northwind Traders requires the following reports:
• Top Products
• Top Customers
• On-Time Shipping
The Top Customers report will show the top 20 customers based on the highest sales amounts in a selected order month or quarter, product category, and sales region.
The Top Products report will show the top 20 products based on the highest sales amounts sold in a selected order month or quarter, sales region, and product category. The report must also show which suppliers provide the top products.
The On-Time Shipping report will show the following metrics for a selected shipping month or quarter:
• The percentage of orders that were shipped late by country and shipping region
• Customers that had multiple late shipments during the last quarter
Northwind Traders defines late orders as those shipped after the required shipping date.
The warehouse shipping department must be notified if the percentage of late orders within the current month exceeds 5%.
The reports must show historical data for the current calendar year and the last three calendar years.
Requirements. Technical Requirements
Northwind Traders identifies the following technical requirements:
• A single dataset must support all three reports.
• The reports must be stored in a single Power BI workspace.
• Report data must be current as of 7 AM Pacific Time each day.
• The reports must provide fast response times when users interact with a visualization.
• The data model must minimize the size of the dataset as much as possible, while meeting the report requirements and the technical requirements.
Requirements. Security Requirements
Access to the reports must be granted to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) security groups only. An Azure AD security group exists for each department.
The sales department must be able to perform the following tasks in Power BI:
• Create, edit, and delete content in the reports.
• Manage permissions for workspaces, datasets, and reports.
• Publish, unpublish, update, and change the permissions for an app.
• Assign Azure AD groups role-based access to the reports workspace.
Users in the sales department must be able to access only the data of the sales region to which they are assigned in the Sales Employees table.
Power BI has the following row-level security (RLS) Table filter DAX expression for the Sales Employees table.
[EmailAddress] = USERNAME()
RLS will be applied only to the sales department users. Users in all other departments must be able to view all the data.

D. OData Feed

Azure DevOps Analytics views expose data through OData feeds.
Using the OData Feed connector allows Power BI to pull data from Azure DevOps Analytics while leveraging its built-in filtering capabilities.

Why not the other options?
A. OData Queries: While this is a generic term, Power BI uses the "OData Feed" connector to interact with OData sources.
B. Azure DevOps (Boards only): This connector is designed specifically for Azure Boards data but doesn't support Analytics views or advanced filtering.

Fact Table: Test Result
Surrogate Key in Patient Table: Patient Key
The fact table is the central table in a star schema and contains measurable data (e.g., metrics, values) and foreign keys to connect to dimension tables.
The Test Result table is the fact table because:
It contains measurable data like "result value."
It includes foreign keys to dimensions like date, test key, and patient key.
A surrogate key is a unique identifier for a row in a table, typically used as the primary key in star schemas. 
The Patient Key is explicitly stated as the unique identifier for rows, making it the surrogate key.

First

Why enable fuzzy matching? Since it says the Contacts table is filled using a web-based form without data sanitisation, there may be inconsistencies in how customer names are entered. Fuzzy matching will help match similar strings, accommodating for typos, capitalisation differences, and other minor variations in the customer names.

You have a collection of reports for the HR department of your company. The datasets use row-level security (RLS). The company has multiple sales regions.
Each sales region has an HR manager.
You need to ensure that the HR managers can interact with the data from their region only. The HR managers must be prevented from changing the layout of the reports.
How should you provision access to the reports for the HR managers?
A. Publish the reports in an app and grant the HR managers access permission.
B. Create a new workspace, copy the datasets and reports, and add the HR managers as members of the workspace.
C. Publish the reports to a different workspace other than the one hosting the datasets.
D. Add the HR managers as members of the existing workspace that hosts the reports and the datasets.

Option A (Publish the reports in an app and grant the HR managers access permission) would be the best option to provide the HR managers with access to the reports while restricting them from modifying the layout.

By publishing the reports in an app and granting the HR managers access permission, you can assign them specific roles and permissions that restrict their access to the underlying data while allowing them to view and interact with the reports. The RLS configuration can be set up to ensure that the HR managers can only see data from their own sales region.

You need to prevent report recipients from reading the analyzed emails. The solution must minimize the model size.
What should you do?
A. From Model view, set the Subject and Body columns to Hidden.
B. Remove the Subject and Body columns during the import.
C. Implement row-level security (RLS) so that the report recipients can only see results based on the emails they sent.

Highly Voted comment found!
B is the best option to prevent report recipients from reading the analyzed emails and minimize the model size.

Removing the Subject and Body columns during the import process ensures that they are not included in the model, which prevents report recipients from being able to access the analyzed email content.

A and C are not effective solutions for preventing report recipients from reading the analyzed emails.

A: Hiding the Subject and Body columns in the model view may prevent report recipients from seeing the content in the report, but the data is still stored in the model and can potentially be accessed by someone with the appropriate permissions.
C: Implementing row-level security (RLS) restricts data access based on user roles or permissions, but it does not prevent access to the analyzed email content in the model.

You need to recommend a solution to improve the performance of the report.

D. Split the visuals onto multiple pages.

Correct answer:  
D. Split the visuals onto multiple pages.
******************************
Highly Voted comment found!
D is the correct answer. Because our report page contains a large number of visuals (both default and AppSource visuals) and users are experiencing slow load times, splitting the visuals onto multiple pages can help. This way, each page loads a subset of visuals, reducing the initial load time and improving the overall performance of the report. Users can navigate between pages to access different sets of visuals.

Answer should be A, from the Microsoft documentation (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/guidance/rls-guidance): 
"When a report user is assigned to multiple roles, RLS filters become additive. It means report users can see table rows that represent the union of those filters." 

This means that you would see all data where either Role1 OR Role2 applies, so the answer is A not D.

Silly comments here. One-to-many because several products have the same product category. Single because the performance is much better and the assignment states only that you need to be able to analyze sales by product category.

You are modeling data by using Microsoft Power BI. Part of the data model is a large Microsoft SQL Server table named Order that has more than 100 million records.
During the development process, you need to import a sample of the data from the Order table.
Solution: You add a report-level filter that filters based on the order date.
Does this meet the goal?
A. Yes
B. No

Highly Voted comment found!
It says "you want to import sample data".  If you are filter at a chart level, you have already imported the data, so the answer is no
******************************
Highly Voted comment found!
B is the correct answer. 
Adding a report-level filter based on the order date doesn't meet the goal of importing a sample of the data from the Order table. A report-level filter affects the data that is displayed within the report but doesn't change the data imported into the data model. To import sample of the data, we need to apply a filter during the data loading process, such as using Power Query Editor or SQL query options, to select a subset of the records from the Order table before importing it into the data model.

I dont understand What micorsoft hopes to achieve with trick questions. If questions leave so much to the analysts assumptions then the questions isnt testing the candidates knowledge
******************************
Highly Voted comment found!
The answer is correct. However, I believe the alternate solution given is wrong. I would say that 3 relationships for each date respectively would be made from the Date table to the Sales table. One being active and the other two inactive. Thus, allowing to filter by a specific date column

The solution suggested is not required, as the report does not require any output that involves all 3 dates. It requires only sales over one date column at a time. Moreover, being date tables, they can significantly increase the size of the model (considering that the table is sales related).

My answer is
NO
NO
YES
Summarizing Orders by CustomerID, OrderId and OrderDate means to group by CustomerID, OrderId and OrderDate and to aggregate the rest of the fields, however the OrderId has unique values so the aggregation will have the same number of rows as the original table
******************************
Highly Voted comment found!
Box1: Yes
The summarizing data will remove Product information which is not required for this analysis. We should not infer from the sample data that OrderId is the primary key for few reasons. 1) the Order table is a common table that is used by Microsoft in learning materials, and the table usually has a surrogate key as the primary key. 2) Order ID can be printed on the invoice, and it is not a surrogate key. BTW, the Customer ID is not a surrogate key as well. 3) An order usually consists of multiple products. 4) The Product Id is unique in the sample data as well, and we won't infer that we must create an order for a separate product.

Box 2: No
Customer ID is required for new and returned customer analysis

Box3: Yes
Product information is not required for analysis.

Note: if the first analysis requirement changes from "Total sales over time" to "Total sales over time for products", we will have a different question to deal with

There are two requirements to the question - improve the performance and enable the required analysis.  Removing the GUID column will do exactly that - it will improve the performance because it is one less column of data to load but it still enables the required analysis given the IOT ID column is equally unique.
******************************
Highly Voted comment found!
Chatgpt: B. No, removing the IoT GUID column and retaining the IoT ID column will not meet the goal of analyzing IoT events by the hour and day of the year. The IoT GUID and IoT ID columns are both unique identifiers for each row in the query, and removing either of them would result in losing important information about each event. In order to analyze events by the hour and day of the year, it is necessary to split the DateTime column into separate Date and Time columns, as well as retaining the unique identifiers for each event. Removing the IoT GUID column would not improve dataset performance, as it does not have any impact on the analysis or querying of the data.

Incorrect answer.

1.Calculate
2. ALLSELECTED.

ALLSELECTED Removes only the filter on the expression visual but respect all external filters.
******************************
Highly Voted comment found!
The tricky thing here is that the report contains a report-level filter for Products and you need to calculate all sales (for all products) for the divisor. So I'll share here both functions definition from dax.guide:

ALLSELECTED: Returns all the rows in a table, or all the values in a column, ignoring any filters that might have been applied inside the query, but keeping filters that come from outside.

ALL: Returns all the rows in a table, or all the values in a column, ignoring any filters that might have been applied.

So, for me the correct answer is CALCULATE & ALL

Highly Voted comment found!
AC is the correct answer. According to https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/transform-model/desktop-date-tables, marking a table as a Date Table automatically removes the auto-generated date table.
******************************
Highly Voted comment found!
This is the tricky question. If I could, I would go with A, B and C. 
As, first, you'll need to create a date table and mark it as the Date Table. Second you'll need to create the relationship between this table and the Sales table. And lastly, you will need to disable auto date and time option, as per this article, it will decrease the model size.

Option A and C does not decrease the model size.
Marking a table as a Date table does not automatically remove the auto-hierarchies in other tables, which makes your data model bigger, so you DO need to disable the auto date/time option.

You have a CSV file that contains user complaints. The file contains a column named Logged. Logged contains the date and time each complaint occurred. The data in Logged is in the following format: 2018-12-31 at 08:59.
You need to be able to analyze the complaints by the logged date and use a built-in date hierarchy.
What should you do?
A. Apply a transformation to extract the first 11 characters of the logged column.
B. Add a conditional column that outputs 2018 if the Logged column starts with 2018 and set the data type of the new column to Whole Number.
C. Create a column by example that starts with 2018-12-31 and set the data type of the new column to Date.
D. Apply a transformation to extract the last 11 characters of the Logged column and set the data type of the new column to Date.

Highly Voted comment found!
Option C should be the correct answer not option B
******************************
Highly Voted comment found!
To analyze the complaints by the logged date and use a built-in date hierarchy, we need to extract the date portion of the "Logged" column and convert it to a date format. Therefore, the best option among the given choices is:

A. Apply a transformation to extract the first 11 characters of the logged column.

Since the date value is stored in the first 11 characters of the "Logged" column, extracting those characters using the "Extract" transformation in Power Query will give us the date value in the format "yyyy-MM-dd". We can then set the data type of the new column to "Date" to convert it into a date format. This will allow us to analyze the complaints by the logged date and use the built-in date hierarchy in Power BI.

Option B is not necessary and will not achieve the desired result. Option C will create a single date value and not allow us to analyze the complaints by the logged date. Option D suggested extracting the last 11 characters, but they contain both date and time values and may not result in the correct date format.

Solution: You create a custom column that concatenates the IoT GUID column and the IoT ID column and then delete the IoT GUID and IoT ID columns.
Does this meet the goal?
A. Yes
B. No

Highly Voted comment found!
No, creating a custom column that concatenates the IoT GUID and IoT ID columns and then deleting the IoT GUID and IoT ID columns will not help in analyzing IoT events by the hour and day of the year. The solution does not address the need to extract the hour and day of the year from the DateTime column, which is essential for the required analysis.

To analyze IoT events by the hour and day of the year, you need to extract the hour and day of the year from the DateTime column and create new columns for them. This can be done using the Power Query Editor in Power BI. Once the new columns are created, you can use them to group and aggregate the data by hour and day of the year, respectively. This approach will also help to improve dataset performance by reducing the amount of data that needs to be processed.
******************************

A. Yes, creating a custom column that concatenates the IoT GUID column and the IoT ID column and then deleting the IoT GUID and IoT ID columns can improve dataset performance and meet the goal of analyzing IoT events by the hour and day of the year. By combining the two columns into one custom column, it reduces the number of columns in the dataset and simplifies the query, which can improve performance. Additionally, the concatenated column can be used to group and analyze events by the hour and day of the year.

"Orders are uniquely identified by using the order ID and can have multiple order lines" - I think the important statement is "and can have multiple order lines" which means that the order ID can appear more than once in the table if the order contains more than one products - so I think the answer is correct.

Correct Answer

To create a calculated table named Numbers in Power BI Desktop that contains all the integers from -100 to 100, you can use the following DAX calculation:

Numbers = GENERATESERIES(-100, 100, 1)

Explanation:

The GENERATESERIES function generates a table of values that starts at the first argument (-100), ends at the second argument (100), and increments by the third argument (1) in this case. The resulting table will contain all the integers from -100 to 100 inclusive.

The calculated table is named "Numbers" and is created by assigning the output of the GENERATESERIES function to it using the "=" operator.

E. Disable the load for the Sales Data query.

Highly Voted comment found!
Please be responsible. Comment and vote carefully.
The answer is A&E.	
To choose reference or duplicate or copy, the points are:
1: Reference, duplicate, copy queries will all make the file bigger to a similar size.
2: Choose Reference if you want the referenced queries to change when the original query changes. Choose Duplicate or Copy if you don’t want that. Reference queries is more common in many real-world scenarios because the fact table is always changing.
3: Copy and Duplicate copy the transformation steps but reference not.
Disable the load for the Sales Data query will : (1) It will be cleaner in Power BI desktop because you won’t see the Sales data query. (2) improve performance. The star schema is normally the best in Power Bi modelling because of the performance. And this is the reason why we need to separate the main table into different tables(Normalization). The main table itself should not be included in a star scheme.

You are creating a Power BI report that will show the number of current employees over time. The report will use Import storage mode for all tables.
The employment data will be imported from Azure SQL Database in a monthly snapshot. The data will be stored in a table named Headcount and will contain the following:
• One row per employee for each month the employee is employed
• In each row, a date key that shows the first day of the month of each snapshot
You have a related date table that contains dates for the years 2020 to 2030.
You need to create a semi-additive DAX measure that will return the count of employees for the last available date in a year, quarter, or month.
How should you complete the measure? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.

LASTNONBLANK doesn't work as it requires 2 inputs

LastDate('headcount'[datekey])/ FirstDate('headcount'[datekey]) doesn't work simply because firstdate and lastdate requires a date. Datekey is not a date

Therefore, Lastdate('date'[date]) is correct
******************************
Highly Voted comment found!
CountRows("HeadCount")
LastDate(headcount["DateKey"])

Why?
The first to count the number of employes

The second because if we use lastDate over Date it will retrieve always the 31 december 2030 (It says that in date table are present dates from 2020 to 2030)

So the result will always be the same. But if we take the lastDate in the DateKey we'll have the first day of the month and year of the last snapshot. 

Am i correct?

Reference is the most common way to replicate origninal query. 
Clear "enable load" to "All Sales" cause the data of this query is now loaded to other table. It is not necessary to load it to Report view anymore
******************************
Highly Voted comment found!
The question provides the answer. We are referencing All Sales for all three tables, and then we are clearing Enable load for All Sales to reduce the data model and increase performance.

Referencing will reduce maintenance because the three tables will be derived from the original data and we can keep the transformations to the source data without having to modify three queries.

I would go for CALCULATE and KEEPFILTERS. CALCULATE evaluates a single expression (like [Sales]) within a modified filter context. In this scenario case, you want to filter the 'Unit'[Color] to "blue" while maintaining the existing filter context.
CALCULATETABLE would return a table, which would then need to be aggregated further (e.g., using SUMX), making it less direct and has a layer of complexity. Second one , use KEEPFILTERS is the most appropriate for ensuring that the filter for blue is added to the existing context without overriding it.

You have a Power BI semantic model named Model1 that runs in Import storage mode.
You need to reduce the size of Model1.
Which two actions should you perform? Each correct answer presents a complete solution.
NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.
A. Summarize the detail data.
B. Upgrade to Power BI premium.
C. Implement row-level security (RLS).
D. Optimize the column data types.
E. Change the active relationships between tables to inactive relationships.

Highly Voted comment found!
Presented answer is correct  A. Summarize the detail data:
Since Import mode loads the entire dataset into memory, reducing the amount of detail data (for example, aggregating granular data like daily sales into monthly or yearly totals) can significantly reduce the size of the model in memory. This approach helps minimize memory usage and improves query performance.
D. Optimize the column data types:

In Import mode, data is compressed and optimized by the VertiPaq storage engine. Using more efficient column data types reduces memory consumption and ensures better compression when the data is loaded into memory. For instance, using integer or decimal data types instead of string can help achieve better compression and optimize performance. link: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/connect-data/service-dataset-modes-understand

I would suggest :
1. Auto Date/Time 
Auto Date/Time is a Power BI feature that automatically creates a Date Hierarchy (Year, Quarter, Month, Day) when a Date column is present.
In the provided screenshot, the Date table has an automatically generated hierarchy, indicating that Auto Date/Time was enabled.
Marking a table as a Date table disables Auto Date/Time, removing any automatically generated date hierarchies.

2. The MonthEndDate Date Hierarchy from the Data Table

Auto Date/Time was used, removing it will delete automatically created hierarchies (e.g., MonthEndDate Date Hierarchy).

You have two Power BI reports named ReportA and ReportB that each uses a distinct color palette.
You are creating a Power BI dashboard that will include two visuals from each report.
You need to use a consistent dark theme for the dashboard. The solution must preserve the original colors of the reports.

B. For the browser, set the color preference to dark mode.
C. When pinning visuals to the dashboard, select Use destination theme.
D. Select the dark dashboard theme.
E. Turn on tile flow.

Highly Voted comment found!
Answer is correct.
I guess, with the requirement "The solution must preserve the original colors of the reports." they only want to point out, that the colors must not be changed FOR the reports to achieve the goal, but only change the theme for the dashboard. A little misleading, IMHO. 
B is wrong, because the dark mode is a personal setting on the user's computer and has nothing to do with the dashboard theme, which is required to be dark.
******************************

The option C is not correct. If we must preserve the original colors of the reports we should select the "keep current theme" option instead of "Use destination theme".
I only see one right option, the "D" one. We could upload a snapshot but it would be a static image, so it makes no sense.

You should use a decomposition tree visual to enable the ad hoc exploration of data as shown in the exhibit.

A decomposition tree is a type of visual that is used to represent hierarchical data in a tree-like structure. It is commonly used to explore data and identify trends and patterns in the data. The visual consists of nodes that represent different data points, with the root node at the top and the child nodes branching out from it. The size and color of the nodes can be used to represent different data values or categories.

The exhibit in the question shows a visual with multiple nodes that can be expanded or collapsed to reveal more detailed data. This is consistent with the behavior of a decomposition tree visual, which allows users to drill down into the data to explore it in more detail.

2 bookmarks -DISPLAY. It took me a while to reproduce the case study. Let me explain.
I have one report with two visuals, sales by Country, sales by month.
I add a slicer >option style: Tile
Then on the View Menu > Show Panes sub menu, i Click Selection -> displays Selection Panes.
In the pane, I hide Sales by Country. I create a bookmark named Sales By Month.
My bookmark only needs to react on visibility of the visual, not the data so I uncheck data and i keep DISPLAY
Then I show Sales by country and I hide Sales By Month. I create a bookmark named Sales by Country.
In INSERT menu > Elements I add a Bookmark button named Sales by country > action bookmark : SalesByCountry.
Same operation for Sales by Month.

I test the behaviour : Ctrl click on Sales by country button will only show the corresponding visual and will not change the slicer.

SO, I used 2 bookmarks with the Display option checked and the data option unchecked.

Answer is A
The decomposition tree visual in Power BI lets you visualize data across multiple dimensions. It automatically aggregates data and enables drilling down into your dimensions in any order.
The key influencers visual helps you understand the factors that drive a metric you're interested in. It analyzes your data, ranks the factors that matter, and displays them as key influencers.
*Key influencers does not visualize data across dimensions*

B. Add a trend line to the scatter plot.
C. Enable high-density sampling on the scatter plot.
D. Apply a row filter to the Data1 query in Power Query Editor.

Highly Voted comment found!
This question requires "modification" of the scatter plot and what high-density sampling essentially does is to employ methods that capture and represent the underlying data more effectively and eliminates overlapping points. 
Remember that the table named Data1 contains 10 million rows. How do you represent all that data in a scatter plot in a meaningful pattern for easy understanding and analysis? by use of high density sampling. 
"By definition, high-density data is sampled to create visualizations reasonably quickly that are responsive to interactivity. Too many data points on a visual can bog it down, and can detract from the visibility of trends".

because the solution must minimize development and maintenance effort as pages are added to the report. If we add more pages the report they will be automatically added to the page navigator. Only thing is you have to change 'show hidden pages' option to off. 
But with the bookmark navigator, lot of efforts required to create individual bookmark to each page and also the newly added pages manually. another problem is it also adds all other bookmarks to the navigator which we dont need.

D. Create a theme as a JSON file and import the theme into Power BI Desktop.

To create a Power BI theme that can be used across multiple reports and workspaces, the best approach would be to create a theme as a JSON file and then import it into Power BI Desktop. This will allow you to define the corporate branding for font size, color, and bar chart formatting in a single file, which can then be easily imported into all the reports that require it.

To create a theme as a JSON file, you can use the built-in Theme Generator tool in Power BI or create the file manually. Once you have the JSON file, you can import it into Power BI Desktop by going to the "Switch Theme" menu and selecting "Import Theme." From there, you can select the JSON file and apply the theme to the current report.


No confusion, and no need to discuss further

This question is in continuation of the series question # 22 of Topic 3.
Answer is Yes
We can definitely create a median line for the measure of salary (Tested)
Also the other solution in this series is create a percentile line at 50% for the salary measure because percentile value at 50 % is exactly equal to the median value.

• A card named Sales Summary
• A clustered bar chart named Sales by Region
You need to ensure that Sales Summary renders on top of Shape1.

B. Layer order in the Selection pane
C. Maintain layer order in the General visual settings
D. Vertical alignment in the Canvas settings

Highly Voted comment found!
B. Layer order in the Selection pane

To ensure that Sales Summary renders on top of Shape1, you need to adjust their layer order in the Selection pane. Power BI renders visuals based on the layer order in the Selection pane, with the topmost visual being rendered last and therefore appearing on top of other visuals.

To adjust the layer order, you can select the visuals in the Selection pane and drag them up or down to change their position in the layer order. In this case, you would want to select Sales Summary and drag it above Shape1 in the layer order to ensure it is rendered on top.

B. Pin the Sales by month bar chart to Dashboard1.

When you pin a visual to a dashboard, you are essentially taking a snapshot of that visual at that point in time and adding it to the dashboard as a tile. Any changes made to the original visual in the report will not automatically reflect in the dashboard tile. To display the bar chart on Dashboard1, you need to pin the new Sales by month bar chart to Dashboard1.

If you change the visualization type in the report after you pinned it to your dashboard, the dashboard tile does not automatically update. So, if you used the Power BI service to pin the visualization as a line chart and then, in the report, changed it to a bar chart, the already-pinned version of this data will remain a line chart. Pin the bar chart to see it too on the dashboard.

To enable the finance team to use Microsoft Excel to analyze the Finance dataset, you need to provide them with an Excel workbook that is connected to the dataset. This can be done by installing the Power BI publisher for Excel add-in, connecting to the Finance dataset, and then importing the data into Excel. Once the data is in Excel, the finance team can use all of Excel's analytical capabilities to analyze and visualize the data.

Granting build permissions (A) or write permissions (D) to the Finance dataset would allow the finance team to modify the dataset, which is not necessary for their analysis needs. Creating a row-level security (RLS) role and adding the finance team as members (C) would only be necessary if you needed to restrict access to specific rows of data in the Finance dataset based on user roles or permissions.

Both Answers are Column Quality 

Column Quality:

The Column quality feature in Power Query provides a visual summary of the column data, including:
The percentage of valid values.
The percentage of error values.
The percentage of empty (null) values.
This is exactly what you need to see both the percentage of errors and the count of empty values.
Column Profile:

The Column profile provides a statistical overview of the data, such as distinct values, unique values, and value distribution. While useful, it does not specifically display the percentage of errors or count of empty values.
Column Distribution:

The Column distribution feature shows the frequency distribution of values in the column as a bar chart. It is not used for viewing errors or empty values.

After two months of inactivity, scheduled refresh on your dataset is paused. A dataset is considered inactive when no user has visited any dashboard or report built on the dataset. At that time, the dataset owner is sent an email indicating the scheduled refresh is paused. The refresh schedule for the dataset is then displayed as disabled. To resume scheduled refresh, simply revisit any dashboard or report built on the dataset.

It is common practice that the PBI developer creates RLS groups and instructs the network team to create the corresponding AD roles. Then the developer assigns the AD groups to the RLS groups.
******************************

C. Instruct the Azure network security team to create security groups and configure RLS to use the groups is the best option in this scenario. This solution allows the Azure network security team to manage RLS membership without granting them access to the reports, datasets, or dashboards. By using security groups, the Azure network security team can add or remove users from the groups, and those changes will automatically apply to the RLS rules. This solution also ensures that the RLS membership is managed by the appropriate team, which is important for security and compliance purposes.

Correction. Microsoft says: To copy a report to another workspace, and to create a report in another workspace based on a dataset in the current workspace, you need Build permission for the dataset. For datasets in the original workspace, if you have at least the Contributor role, you automatically have Build permission through your workspace role.

We can set alerts on KPI, Cards and gauge . 

Alerts aren't supported for card tiles with date or time measures.
Alerts only work with numeric data types.
Alerts only work on refreshed data. They don't work on static data.
Because alerts are only sent if your data changes, you don't receive duplicate alerts for an unchanged value.
Alerts only work on streaming datasets if you build a KPI, card, or gauge report visual and then pin that visual to the dashboard.

You have five sales regions. Each region is assigned a single salesperson.
You have an imported dataset that has a dynamic row-level security (RLS) role named Sales. The Sales role filters sales transaction data by salesperson.
Salespeople must see only the data from their region.
You publish the dataset to powerbi.com, set RLS role membership, and distribute the dataset and related reports to the salespeople.
A salesperson reports that she believes she should see more data.
You need to verify what data the salesperson currently sees.
What should you do?
A. Use the Test as role option to view data as the salesperson's user account.
B. Use the Test as role option to view data as the Sales role.
C. Instruct the salesperson to open the report in Microsoft Power BI Desktop.
D. Filter the data in the reports to match the intended logic in the filter on the sales transaction table.

******************************
Highly Voted comment found!
Correct Answer "A"

A. Yes

The solution meets the goal of granting all organizational users read access to one dashboard and three reports.

By creating an Azure Active Directory (AAD) group that contains all the users and sharing each selected report and the one dashboard to the group, you can grant read access to the selected resources to all users in the organization. This approach simplifies the management of access permissions since you can manage access for all users in one central place, the AAD group, instead of granting permissions to each user individually.

You have a Power BI dataset and a connected report.
You need to ensure that users can analyze data in Microsoft Excel only by connecting directly to the dataset.
You grant the users the Build permission for the dataset.
What should you do next?
A. Certify the dataset used by the report.
B. Change the default visual interaction for the report.
C. For the report, change the Export data setting to None.
D. For the report, change the Export data setting to Summarized data, data with current layout and underlying data.

Highly Voted comment found!
C is the correct answer. Note the part of the question that says "ONLY by connecting directly to the dataset." As mentioned in https://www.designmind.com/blog/business-intelligence/export-underlying-data-in-power-bi, "You should export summarized data when you want to see the relevant data in the visualization." Therefore, D cannot be the right answer, as summarized data is not obtained from connecting directly to the dataset, but rather by effectively filtering the dataset based on the contents of the visualization.

Additionally, the "data with current layout and underlying data" part is irrelevant - by allowing Summarized data to be exported, we allow forms of analyzing data other than connecting directly to the dataset, and thus fail the requirements of the question.
******************************
Highly Voted comment found!
The correct answer is D. C is incorrect because if you change the export data setting to None, users will not be able to export the data in any form.

By providing the users with Summarized data, data with current layout and underlying data option, it will not change the way data is visualized in the report, but it allows the users to download the data and analyze it with Excel.

In this case, Composite fits perfect. Source1 is 2GB, which is relatively too large for daily updates and way larger than Source2 which is only 5MB.

You need to configure access for the sales department users. The solution must the meet the security requirements.
What should you do?
A. Share each report to the Azure Active Directory group of the sales department.
B. Add the Azure Active Directory group of the sales department as an Admin of the reports workspace.
C. Distribute an app to the users in the Azure Active Directory group of the sales department.
D. Add the sales department as a member of the reports workspace.

Highly Voted comment found!
The answer is C. It's a trick question. It asks how the access for the sales department USERS needs to be set up. This requires RLS to work, and RLS won't work when they are member or admin. The requirements listed that require admin rights refer to the sales DEPARTMENT, not to the sales USERS.

Explanation and answer incorrect for the second function, REMOVEFILTERS in the explanation isn't part of the options, instead it should be ALL to remove any context from the calculation. So the final formula should be 
VAR AllCategoryRev = 
   CALCULATE(SUM([Revenue]), 
      ALL(ProductList[ProductCategory])) 
RETURN 
   DIVIDE(SUM([Revenue]), AllCategoryRev)
******************************

ALL[ProductCategory] is the correct option in the second dropdown.

ALLEXCEPT - Removes all context filters in the table except filters that have been applied to the specified columns; so It's wrong and we wouldn't get All the revenue for the divide measure, but only row level ProductCategory revenue

A) - LASTDATE()

******************************
Highly Voted comment found!
B) DATESQTD

The Balance sheet report is a quarterly report so it needs to have the sum of the last three months. The Balances table is reporting in monthly intervals, so it needs to be summed up to produce a quarterly result. That is where DATESQTD comes in, as it states: "Returns a table that contains a column of the dates for the quarter to date, in the current context." LASTDATE() will instead produce a result: "Returns the last date in the current context for the specified column of dates." Which would only show the last month's result.

Answer should be No - Yes - No. According to the sample data the CustomerID in Customer Details is a number (1 through 10 is shown in the example data) and the CustomerID in the Orders table has an example value of VINET, which looks like it corresponds to the value of CustomerCRMID instead of CustomerID from the Customer Details worksheet so the first answer should be No. The second answer should be Yes, the CustomerID from Orders has example value VINET, which is text.

I think that the C option is the correct one.
the option A creates an active relationship between Sales.orderDate and Date and a inactive relationship between sales.shippedDate and Date. However we will have visuals where we will have to filter either shippedDate or orderDate, so we will no be able to filter by shipedDate because of the relationship is inactive (we could create measures using the USERELATIONSHIP() function but this is not the case due to we have to use the filters directly from the visuals)

Many-to-Many
Customer details

Sales employees should see the sales of their region only, so all sales ordered by customers whose billing address belongs to the sales employee's region.
Therefore, the relationship between sales employees (region) and customer details (region) should be many-to-many (a sales employee has many customers in his region and a customer in a region can have many sales employees for that region).
In this case, as the customer table is related to the order table, the sales employees will only be able to see the orders of the customers in their region.
