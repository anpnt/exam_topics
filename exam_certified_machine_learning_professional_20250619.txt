Which of the following describes concept drift?
A. Concept drift is when there is a change in the distribution of an input variable
B. Concept drift is when there is a change in the distribution of a target variable
C. Concept drift is when there is a change in the relationship between input variables and target variables
D. Concept drift is when there is a change in the distribution of the predicted target given by the model
E. None of these describe Concept drift

Highly Voted comment found!
C. Concept drift is when there is a change in the relationship between input variables and target variables.

Concept drift refers to the situation when the statistical properties of the target variable, which the model is trying to predict, change over time in unforeseen ways. This causes the model to become less accurate as time passes.

When a data visualization is logged in an MLflow run, it is stored as an artifact of that run. These artifacts can be viewed in the Artifacts section of the corresponding MLflow Run page in Databricks. This allows data scientists to easily access and review the visualizations generated during the run.

 The MLflow Experiment page provides a high-level overview of all the runs in an experiment, but to view the details of a specific run, including any logged artifacts like data visualizations, you would need to navigate to the specific Run page.

Exam Certified Machine Learning Professional topic 1 question 46 discussion - Dec. 19, 2023, 1:36 a.m.
A machine learning engineer is migrating a machine learning pipeline to use Databricks Machine Learning. They have programmatically identified the best run from an MLflow Experiment and stored its URI in the model_uri variable and its Run ID in the run_id variable. They have also determined that the model was logged with the name "model". Now, the machine learning engineer wants to register that model in the MLflow Model Registry with the name "best_model".
Which of the following lines of code can they use to register the model to the MLflow Model Registry?
A. mlflow.register_model(model_uri, "best_model")
B. mlflow.register_model(run_id, "best_model")
C. mlflow.register_model(f"runs:/{run_id}/best_model", "model")
D. mlflow.register_model(model_uri, "model")
E. mlflow.register_model(f"runs:/{run_id}/model")

Exam Certified Machine Learning Professional topic 1 question 52 discussion - Dec. 28, 2023, 1:10 a.m.
A machine learning engineer wants to log and deploy a model as an MLflow pyfunc model. They have custom preprocessing that needs to be completed on feature variables prior to fitting the model or computing predictions using that model. They decide to wrap this preprocessing in a custom model class ModelWithPreprocess, where the preprocessing is performed when calling fit and when calling predict. They then log the fitted model of the ModelWithPreprocess class as a pyfunc model.
Which of the following is a benefit of this approach when loading the logged pyfunc model for downstream deployment?
A. The pyfunc model can be used to deploy models in a parallelizable fashion
B. The same preprocessing logic will automatically be applied when calling fit
C. The same preprocessing logic will automatically be applied when calling predict
D. This approach has no impact when loading the logged pyfunc model for downstream deployment
E. There is no longer a need for pipeline-like machine learning objects
