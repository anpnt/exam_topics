S3 Intelligent-Tiering is cost-effective for storing large amounts of video content, and since Lambda doesn't work, shouldn't we consider serverless?
******************************
Highly Voted comment found!
A - Video processing can take up to 20 minutes. So lambda is not suitable here.
B - Fargate allows running containers without managing EC2 instances, scaling automatically based on demand. Besides, S3 Intelligent-Tiering is cost-effective for storing large video files.
C - I gotta say, the SQS is a really good choice here! It's just that S3 Standard is more expensive than S3 Intelligent-Tiering for large files, and that EC2 (even with Auto Scaling) requires managing the underlying infrastructure.
D - EKS is more complex to set up but the real issue is that RDS in a single Availability Zone introduces a single point of failure, so scalability and reliability can't be met. Also, S3 Glacier Deep Archive is designed for long-term archival storage with high latency and not suitable for frequently accessed video content.

A company's software development team needs an Amazon RDS Multi-AZ cluster. The RDS cluster will serve as a backend for a desktop client that is deployed on premises. The desktop client requires direct connectivity to the RDS cluster.
The company must give the development team the ability to connect to the cluster by using the client when the team is in the office.
Which solution provides the required connectivity MOST securely?
A. Create a VPC and two public subnets. Create the RDS cluster in the public subnets. Use AWS Site-to-Site VPN with a customer gateway in the company's office.
B. Create a VPC and two private subnets. Create the RDS cluster in the private subnets. Use AWS Site-to-Site VPN with a customer gateway in the company's office.
C. Create a VPC and two private subnets. Create the RDS cluster in the private subnets. Use RDS security groups to allow the company's office IP ranges to access the cluster.
D. Create a VPC and two public subnets. Create the RDS cluster in the public subnets. Create a cluster user for each developer. Use RDS security groups to allow the users to access the cluster.

Highly Voted comment found!
The Correct Answer is B.
Explanation:
VPC and Private Subnets: By placing the RDS cluster in private subnets, you ensure that the RDS cluster is not publicly accessible from the internet. This significantly improves security as the database is only accessible through secure channels, not directly from the public internet.

AWS Site-to-Site VPN: Using a Site-to-Site VPN establishes a secure, encrypted connection between the on-premises office and the AWS environment. This provides secure access to the RDS cluster without exposing it to the internet, ensuring that the developers can only access the cluster when connected to the office network.

Customer Gateway: The customer gateway is configured in the company's office to handle the VPN connection, providing secure connectivity for the desktop client to the RDS cluster when the development team is in the office.

A - AWS Backup is not required for configuring automated backup retention on RDS. It's native to the RDS service. So not using that will save us a fortune.
B - Disabling backups and then re-enabling a 30-day retention policy? I don't get it
C - Manual deletion will add operational tasks for sure, but in this case, it's actually reasonable and acceptable.
D - Even sounds more absurd than B, because using AWS CloudFormation to automate deletion adds extra complexity.

D. Configure Amazon S3 to allow uploads from CloudFront origin access control (OAC).
E. Configure Amazon S3 to allow uploads from CloudFront. Configure an Amazon S3 website endpoint.

Highly Voted comment found!
Amazon CloudFront requires an SSL/TLS certificate to use HTTPS with a custom domain name. This certificate MUST be provisioned in the us-east-1 Region, regardless of where your content is hosted. This is because CloudFront only supports certificates in the us-east-1 Region for use with custom domain names.
Origin Access Control (OAC) is a feature that allows you to securely upload content to an S3 bucket using CloudFront. It provides fine-grained access control and ensures that only CloudFront can upload files to the S3 bucket, preventing direct access. Configuring S3 to allow uploads from CloudFront using OAC ensures that only CloudFront can interact with the S3 bucket, adding an extra layer of security.

D. Create an Amazon S3 bucket in ap-northeast-1. Set up an Amazon CloudFront distribution. Configure the S3 bucket as the origin. Download the software by using signed URLs.

Highly Voted comment found!
By setting up a CloudFront distribution with the S3 bucket as the origin, the software versions can be cached at edge locations close to the remote AWS Outposts servers. This reduces the latency of downloading new software versions because the servers can access the content from the nearest CloudFront edge location instead of downloading it directly from the S3 bucket in the ap-northeast-1 Region.
About option C: S3 Transfer Acceleration optimizes the upload and download of files to S3 by routing through optimized network paths. However, it is primarily designed to improve performance when transferring data over long distances to S3 (uploads). It does not provide the same level of global caching and latency reduction as CloudFront for large-scale distribution.
******************************
Highly Voted comment found!
Option C is correct.
Option D brings additional overhead in terms of setting up, so opted out.

Also from google :  If you want to download software quickly from a large distance, you should generally use S3 Transfer Acceleration to download from your S3 bucket, as it leverages Amazon's global edge network to significantly speed up long-distance data transfers, making it ideal for large file downloads across continents; while CloudFront is better suited for delivering smaller content like website assets to users globally, where faster response times and caching are critical

Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate SAA-C03 topic 1 question 954 discussion
A company is developing machine learning (ML) models on AWS. The company is developing the ML models as independent microservices. The microservices fetch approximately 1 GB of model data from Amazon S3 at startup and load the data into memory. Users access the ML models through an asynchronous API. Users can send a request or a batch of requests.
The company provides the ML models to hundreds of users. The usage patterns for the models are irregular. Some models are not used for days or weeks. Other models receive batches of thousands of requests at a time.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A. Direct the requests from the API to a Network Load Balancer (NLB). Deploy the ML models as AWS Lambda functions that the NLB will invoke. Use auto scaling to scale the Lambda functions based on the traffic that the NLB receives.
B. Direct the requests from the API to an Application Load Balancer (ALB). Deploy the ML models as Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) services that the ALB will invoke. Use auto scaling to scale the ECS cluster instances based on the traffic that the ALB receives.
C. Direct the requests from the API into an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Deploy the ML models as AWS Lambda functions that SQS events will invoke. Use auto scaling to increase the number of vCPUs for the Lambda functions based on the size of the SQS queue.
D. Direct the requests from the API into an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Deploy the ML models as Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) services that read from the queue. Use auto scaling for Amazon ECS to scale both the cluster capacity and number of the services based on the size of the SQS queue.

Highly Voted comment found!
D is the answer:
SQS Queue: Directing API requests to SQS decouples the API from ML processing, efficiently handles high traffic, and ensures reliable request processing without overloading the ML models.

Amazon ECS Services: Running ML models on ECS provides effective management of containerized applications, ideal for handling ML workloads.

Auto Scaling: ECS auto scales based on SQS queue size, adjusting container and cluster capacity to match demand, ensuring efficient handling of varying workloads.

This is A. We care about cost effectiveness. In regards to images being used twice a year "For images accessed only twice a year, S3 Glacier Deep Archive would be the more cost-effective option compared to S3 One Zone Infrequent Access, as it is designed for extremely infrequent access and offers the lowest storage cost within AWS S3 storage classes; while S3 One Zone Infrequent Access is cheaper than standard Infrequent Access, it still might be slightly more expensive for data accessed as rarely as twice a year." In regards to premium users keep them standard. Non premium users can be in the infrequent since they have 6 hrs.

D. Purchase Reserved Instances for a 3 year term with the All Upfront option for the Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL workloads. Purchase a 3 year EC2 Instance Savings Plan with the All Upfront option for the EC2 instances.

Highly Voted comment found!
What you should know:
1. No Upfront - Pay nothing at the time of purchase. Payments are spread out monthly over the term (1 or 3 years). Lowest savings with high flexibility.
2. Partial Upfront - Pay a portion of the cost upfront, with reduced monthly payments over the term. Moderate savings with moderate flexibility.
3. All Upfront - Pay the full cost upfront at the time of purchase. No additional payments required during the term. Highest savings with the least flexibility.

Merely by the question, option D would be the answer because it's best for companies with a stable workload, long-term commitment, and sufficient budget for upfront payments.

Just to add something, generally option C would be the best in real world cases because it strikes a good balance between savings and upfront investment, and uitable for mid-term commitments with moderate budget flexibility.

D simplifies the process by directly using S3 Standard-IA and then transitioning to S3 Glacier Deep Archive, which aligns well with access patterns and cost requirements. Option A sounds right but using an archive tool to group files into large objects adds complexity and operational overhead. This step isn’t necessary if you can directly manage the files with S3 lifecycle policies.

I would go with Lambda and SQS.
when using SQS we will be sure that all images will be processed and hence to process we need 2 min and 512 MB of memory (Lambda is allowing upto 15 min and upto10K MB) Lambda should be perfect scalable solution which will allow for almost in real time image processing.

Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?
A. Create dedicated S3 access points and access point policies for each application.
B. Create an S3 Batch Operations job to set the ACL permissions for each object in the S3 bucket.
C. Replicate the objects in the S3 bucket to new S3 buckets for each application. Create replication rules by prefix.
D. Replicate the objects in the S3 bucket to new S3 buckets for each application. Create dedicated S3 access points for each application.

Highly Voted comment found!
Answer A
By creating separate access points for each application, you can enforce access controls specific to their respective prefixes while minimizing administrative complexity. This approach provides a clean separation of permissions and reduces the risk of misconfigurations.

Options B, C, and D are not as efficient or straightforward:

Option B (S3 Batch Operations) involves setting ACL permissions for each object individually, which can be cumbersome and time-consuming.
Option C (replicating objects to new S3 buckets) introduces additional buckets and replication rules, increasing management overhead.
Option D (replicating objects and creating dedicated S3 access points) adds unnecessary complexity by combining replication and access point creation.

Although it's not stated what is meant by 'rarely accessed', this scenario would primarily be a candidate for the Glacier Instant Retrieval tier as the storage price would be more than 3 times lower compared to Standard IA. In the specific case of files being more frequently retrieved than quarterly, it can qualify for consideration of Standard IA.

A company has deployed a multi-account strategy on AWS by using AWS Control Tower. The company has provided individual AWS accounts to each of its developers. The company wants to implement controls to limit AWS resource costs that the developers incur.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?
A. Instruct each developer to tag all their resources with a tag that has a key of CostCenter and a value of the developer's name. Use the required-tags AWS Config managed rule to check for the tag. Create an AWS Lambda function to terminate resources that do not have the tag. Configure AWS Cost Explorer to send a daily report to each developer to monitor their spending.
B. Use AWS Budgets to establish budgets for each developer account. Set up budget alerts for actual and forecast values to notify developers when they exceed or expect to exceed their assigned budget. Use AWS Budgets actions to apply a DenyAll policy to the developer's IAM role to prevent additional resources from being launched when the assigned budget is reached.
C. Use AWS Cost Explorer to monitor and report on costs for each developer account. Configure Cost Explorer to send a daily report to each developer to monitor their spending. Use AWS Cost Anomaly Detection to detect anomalous spending and provide alerts.
D. Use AWS Service Catalog to allow developers to launch resources within a limited cost range. Create AWS Lambda functions in each AWS account to stop running resources at the end of each work day. Configure the Lambda functions to resume the resources at the start of each work day.

Highly Voted comment found!
My first instinct says B, but Im concerned about the central management abilities of AWS Budgets. It seems that even though it is not planned to be used primarily to control other accounts its still possible:
"You can use actions to define an explicit response that you want to take when a budget exceeds its action threshold. You can trigger these alerts on actual or forecasted cost and usage budgets.
1. The management account sets the budget and threshold for the member account using budget filters.
2. When the budget threshold is breached, a budget action applies a restrictive SCP on the OU.

So hopefully B :D

Taking into consideration that AWS Budgets is allowing to will inform you that you exceeded budged and execute actions like for example  IAM actions to prevent running new resources in cloud, I think this option is a good and resonable move. In case of need budged can be always increased and "chains" disabled.

A company runs its application by using Amazon EC2 instances and AWS Lambda functions. The EC2 instances run in private subnets of a VPC. The Lambda functions need direct network access to the EC2 instances for the application to work.
The application will run for 1 year. The number of Lambda functions that the application uses will increase during the 1-year period. The company must minimize costs on all application resources.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A. Purchase an EC2 Instance Savings Plan. Connect the Lambda functions to the private subnets that contain the EC2 instances.
B. Purchase an EC2 Instance Savings Plan. Connect the Lambda functions to new public subnets in the same VPC where the EC2 instances run.
C. Purchase a Compute Savings Plan. Connect the Lambda functions to the private subnets that contain the EC2 instances.
D. Purchase a Compute Savings Plan. Keep the Lambda functions in the Lambda service VPC.

Highly Voted comment found!
Compute Savings Plan: This plan offers significant discounts on Lambda functions compared to on-demand pricing. Since the application will run for a year, a sustained use discount like Compute Savings Plan is ideal.
Private Subnets: Lambda functions in private subnets can directly access EC2 instances within the VPC without needing internet access, reducing security risks and potential egress costs.

A company is hosting a high-traffic static website on Amazon S3 with an Amazon CloudFront distribution that has a default TTL of 0 seconds. The company wants to implement caching to improve performance for the website. However, the company also wants to ensure that stale content is not served for more than a few minutes after a deployment.
Which combination of caching methods should a solutions architect implement to meet these requirements? (Choose two.)
A. Set the CloudFront default TTL to 2 minutes.
B. Set a default TTL of 2 minutes on the S3 bucket.
C. Add a Cache-Control private directive to the objects in Amazon S3.
D. Create an AWS Lambda@Edge function to add an Expires header to HTTP responses. Configure the function to run on viewer response.
E. Add a Cache-Control max-age directive of 24 hours to the objects in Amazon S3. On deployment, create a CloudFront invalidation to clear any changed files from edge caches.

Highly Voted comment found!
AE.
By default, each file automatically expires after 24 hours, but you can change the default behavior in two ways:

1. To change the cache duration for all files that match the same path pattern, you can change the CloudFront settings for Minimum TTL, Maximum TTL, and Default TTL for a cache behavior. 

2. To change the cache duration for an individual file, you can configure your origin to add a Cache-Control header with the max-age or s-maxage directive, or an Expires header to the file.
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html#expiration-individual-objects
******************************

You simply can't have A and E in the same approach:

"Default TTL applies only when your origin does not add HTTP headers such as Cache-Control max-age, Cache-Control s-maxage, or Expires to objects." 

C - Cache-Control private directive specifies that the response is intended for a single user and should not be cached by shared caches - it can still be cached, but only on a client device.

This combination of steps would provide the best solution for the case.

A company creates dedicated AWS accounts in AWS Organizations for its business units. Recently, an important notification was sent to the root user email address of a business unit account instead of the assigned account owner. The company wants to ensure that all future notifications can be sent to different employees based on the notification categories of billing, operations, or security.
Which solution will meet these requirements MOST securely?
A. Configure each AWS account to use a single email address that the company manages. Ensure that all account owners can access the email account to receive notifications. Configure alternate contacts for each AWS account with corresponding distribution lists for the billing team, the security team, and the operations team for each business unit.
B. Configure each AWS account to use a different email distribution list for each business unit that the company manages. Configure each distribution list with administrator email addresses that can respond to alerts. Configure alternate contacts for each AWS account with corresponding distribution lists for the billing team, the security team, and the operations team for each business unit.
C. Configure each AWS account root user email address to be the individual company managed email address of one person from each business unit. Configure alternate contacts for each AWS account with corresponding distribution lists for the billing team, the security team, and the operations team for each business unit.
D. Configure each AWS account root user to use email aliases that go to a centralized mailbox. Configure alternate contacts for each account by using a single business managed email distribution list each for the billing team, the security team, and the operations team.

Highly Voted comment found!
D is correct answer.
Configuring each AWS account's root user to use email aliases that go to a centralized mailbox ensures that sensitive notifications are not directly sent to individual email addresses. Instead, they are directed to a centralized mailbox, reducing the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive information. Additionally, configuring alternate contacts for each account using a single business-managed email distribution list for the billing team, the security team, and the operations team ensures that notifications are appropriately routed to the respective teams based on the categories of billing, operations, or security. This approach centralizes control and reduces the likelihood of misconfiguration or unauthorized access to sensitive notifications.

There is no information about the ports numbers and only that means that we need to use NLB, ALB is only for HTTP hence there is no point of using that solution as connection can be done via any port for exampl 4000

"Amazon S3 managed encryption key" (SSE-S3) is a server-side encryption.  Therefore it is not a client-side encryption.  To encrypt the data before sending to S3, it has to be client-side encryption.

AnswerB
The problem is that we need to choose best solution which is most cost-effective and have minimal administrative effort.
Glacier is the best choice for 1st look, but there is one problem with that solution. From what I know there is no easy way to copy from EBS to Glacier and additionally curent strategy is to make incremental snapshots. To copy file from EBS to (s3) Glacier we would need to run linux to which we will mount EBS and we will need copy everything to S3 and then move to glaceir deep archive. And what is more you will have only incremental snapshot. Hence every solution which will say copy/move to S3 is not minimal administrative effort. Not mentionig that you will not have full snapshot

How much does EBS snapshots archive cost?
Pricing and billing. Archived snapshots are billed at a rate of $0.0125 per GB-month. For example, if you archive a 100 GiB snapshot, you are billed $1.25 (100 GiB * $0.0125) per month.

What is the cost of Glacier?
Even though uploading data to Amazon S3 Glacier is free, there is a pricing method for upload requests, which is $0.03 per 1,000 requests. Transferring data out of S3 Glacier to the same region is free; however, there is a cost for transferring data to a different region.

53 with multivalue is the best option for this case

Multivalue answer routing lets you configure Amazon Route 53 to return multiple values, such as IP addresses for your web servers, in response to DNS queries. You can specify multiple values for almost any record, but multivalue answer routing also lets you check the health of each resource, so Route 53 returns only values for healthy resources. It's not a substitute for a load balancer, but the ability to return multiple health-checkable IP addresses is a way to use DNS to improve availability and load balancing.

An idempotent AWS Lambda function performs each validation step. Each validation step is independent from the other validation steps. Individual validation steps need only a subset of the order event information.
The company wants to ensure that each validation step Lambda function has access to only the information from the order event that the function requires. The components of the order processing system should be loosely coupled to accommodate future business changes.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A. Create an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue for each validation step. Create a new Lambda function to transform the order data to the format that each validation step requires and to publish the messages to the appropriate SQS queues. Subscribe each validation step Lambda function to its corresponding SQS queue.
B. Create an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic. Subscribe the validation step Lambda functions to the SNS topic. Use message body filtering to send only the required data to each subscribed Lambda function.
C. Create an Amazon EventBridge event bus. Create an event rule for each validation step. Configure the input transformer to send only the required data to each target validation step Lambda function.
D. Create an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Create a new Lambda function to subscribe to the SQS queue and to transform the order data to the format that each validation step requires. Use the new Lambda function to perform synchronous invocations of the validation step Lambda functions in parallel on separate threads.

A company is planning to deploy its application on an Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL Serverless v2 cluster. The application will receive large amounts of traffic. The company wants to optimize the storage performance of the cluster as the load on the application increases.
Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?
A. Configure the cluster to use the Aurora Standard storage configuration.
B. Configure the cluster storage type as Provisioned IOPS.
C. Configure the cluster storage type as General Purpose.
D. Configure the cluster to use the Aurora I/O-Optimized storage configuration.

Highly Voted comment found!
AnswerD

For Aurora we have 2 storage type/options: 
A - Standard 
B -- I/O-Optimized 
hence answers B and C options are incorrect.
Because customer inform us that there will be a big amount of traffic for their application I would go with I/O-Optimized. Maybe we are giving more $$ per GB-month but we are not paing for I/O operations/request.

In general question is not precise and it is hard to say which option will be more beneficial (cost effective)

Target groups are just a group of Ec2 instances. Target groups are closely associated with ELB and not ASG. We can just use ELB and Target groups to route requests to EC2 instances. With this setup, there is no autoscaling which means instances cannot be added or removed when your load increases/decreases.

Lambda has 15 mins limit, so A is out.

B works, but you have to run highly-available virtual machines or containers waiting for the event to happen.

C is the best answer in this question, with AWS Fargate allows you to pay for only what you use and free you from provisioning, configuring, and scaling clusters of Amazon EC2 instances.
