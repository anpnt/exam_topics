Exam AWS Certified Developer - Associate DVA-C02 topic 1 question 1 discussion - March 16, 2023, 9:21 a.m.
A company is implementing an application on Amazon EC2 instances. The application needs to process incoming transactions. When the application detects a transaction that is not valid, the application must send a chat message to the company's support team. To send the message, the application needs to retrieve the access token to authenticate by using the chat API.
A developer needs to implement a solution to store the access token. The access token must be encrypted at rest and in transit. The access token must also be accessible from other AWS accounts.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST management overhead?
A. Use an AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store SecureString parameter that uses an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) AWS managed key to store the access token. Add a resource-based policy to the parameter to allow access from other accounts. Update the IAM role of the EC2 instances with permissions to access Parameter Store. Retrieve the token from Parameter Store with the decrypt flag enabled. Use the decrypted access token to send the message to the chat.
B. Encrypt the access token by using an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer managed key. Store the access token in an Amazon DynamoDB table. Update the IAM role of the EC2 instances with permissions to access DynamoDB and AWS KMS. Retrieve the token from DynamoDDecrypt the token by using AWS KMS on the EC2 instances. Use the decrypted access token to send the message to the chat.
C. Use AWS Secrets Manager with an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer managed key to store the access token. Add a resource-based policy to the secret to allow access from other accounts. Update the IAM role of the EC2 instances with permissions to access Secrets Manager. Retrieve the token from Secrets Manager. Use the decrypted access token to send the message to the chat.
D. Encrypt the access token by using an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) AWS managed key. Store the access token in an Amazon S3 bucket. Add a bucket policy to the S3 bucket to allow access from other accounts. Update the IAM role of the EC2 instances with permissions to access Amazon S3 and AWS KMS. Retrieve the token from the S3 bucket. Decrypt the token by using AWS KMS on the EC2 instances. Use the decrypted access token to send the massage to the chat.

A company is running Amazon EC2 instances in multiple AWS accounts. A developer needs to implement an application that collects all the lifecycle events of the EC2 instances. The application needs to store the lifecycle events in a single Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue in the company's main AWS account for further processing.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A. Configure Amazon EC2 to deliver the EC2 instance lifecycle events from all accounts to the Amazon EventBridge event bus of the main account. Add an EventBridge rule to the event bus of the main account that matches all EC2 instance lifecycle events. Add the SQS queue as a target of the rule.
B. Use the resource policies of the SQS queue in the main account to give each account permissions to write to that SQS queue. Add to the Amazon EventBridge event bus of each account an EventBridge rule that matches all EC2 instance lifecycle events. Add the SQS queue in the main account as a target of the rule.
C. Write an AWS Lambda function that scans through all EC2 instances in the company accounts to detect EC2 instance lifecycle changes. Configure the Lambda function to write a notification message to the SQS queue in the main account if the function detects an EC2 instance lifecycle change. Add an Amazon EventBridge scheduled rule that invokes the Lambda function every minute.
D. Configure the permissions on the main account event bus to receive events from all accounts. Create an Amazon EventBridge rule in each account to send all the EC2 instance lifecycle events to the main account event bus. Add an EventBridge rule to the main account event bus that matches all EC2 instance lifecycle events. Set the SQS queue as a target for the rule.

A developer is creating an AWS CloudFormation template to deploy Amazon EC2 instances across multiple AWS accounts. The developer must choose the EC2 instances from a list of approved instance types.
How can the developer incorporate the list of approved instance types in the CloudFormation template?
A. Create a separate CloudFormation template for each EC2 instance type in the list.
B. In the Resources section of the CloudFormation template, create resources for each EC2 instance type in the list.
C. In the CloudFormation template, create a separate parameter for each EC2 instance type in the list.
D. In the CloudFormation template, create a parameter with the list of EC2 instance types as AllowedValues.

Highly Voted comment found!
Option D is the correct answer. In the CloudFormation template, the developer should create a parameter with the list of approved EC2 instance types as AllowedValues. This way, users can select the instance type they want to use when launching the CloudFormation stack, but only from the approved list.

Option A is not a scalable solution as it requires creating a separate CloudFormation template for each EC2 instance type, which can become cumbersome and difficult to manage as the number of approved instance types grows.

Option B is not necessary as creating resources for each EC2 instance type in the list would not enforce the requirement to choose only from the approved list. It would also increase the complexity of the template and make it difficult to manage.

Option C is not ideal as it would require creating a separate parameter for each EC2 instance type, which can become difficult to manage as the number of approved instance types grows. Also, it does not enforce the requirement to choose only from the approved list.

A developer has an application that makes batch requests directly to Amazon DynamoDB by using the BatchGetItem low-level API operation. The responses frequently return values in the UnprocessedKeys element.
Which actions should the developer take to increase the resiliency of the application when the batch response includes values in UnprocessedKeys? (Choose two.)
A. Retry the batch operation immediately.
B. Retry the batch operation with exponential backoff and randomized delay.
C. Update the application to use an AWS software development kit (AWS SDK) to make the requests.
D. Increase the provisioned read capacity of the DynamoDB tables that the operation accesses.
E. Increase the provisioned write capacity of the DynamoDB tables that the operation accesses.

Highly Voted comment found!
(B) If you delay the batch operation using exponential backoff, the individual requests in the batch are much more likely to succeed. 
(D) The most likely cause of a failed read or a failed write is throttling. For BatchGetItem, one or more of the tables in the batch request does not have enough provisioned read capacity to support the operation

A developer is creating an application that will give users the ability to store photos from their cellphones in the cloud. The application needs to support tens of thousands of users. The application uses an Amazon API Gateway REST API that is integrated with AWS Lambda functions to process the photos. The application stores details about the photos in Amazon DynamoDB.
Users need to create an account to access the application. In the application, users must be able to upload photos and retrieve previously uploaded photos. The photos will range in size from 300 KB to 5 MB.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?
A. Use Amazon Cognito user pools to manage user accounts. Create an Amazon Cognito user pool authorizer in API Gateway to control access to the API. Use the Lambda function to store the photos and details in the DynamoDB table. Retrieve previously uploaded photos directly from the DynamoDB table.
B. Use Amazon Cognito user pools to manage user accounts. Create an Amazon Cognito user pool authorizer in API Gateway to control access to the API. Use the Lambda function to store the photos in Amazon S3. Store the object's S3 key as part of the photo details in the DynamoDB table. Retrieve previously uploaded photos by querying DynamoDB for the S3 key.
C. Create an IAM user for each user of the application during the sign-up process. Use IAM authentication to access the API Gateway API. Use the Lambda function to store the photos in Amazon S3. Store the object's S3 key as part of the photo details in the DynamoDB table. Retrieve previously uploaded photos by querying DynamoDB for the S3 key.
D. Create a users table in DynamoDB. Use the table to manage user accounts. Create a Lambda authorizer that validates user credentials against the users table. Integrate the Lambda authorizer with API Gateway to control access to the API. Use the Lambda function to store the photos in Amazon S3. Store the object's S3 key as par of the photo details in the DynamoDB table. Retrieve previously uploaded photos by querying DynamoDB for the S3 key.

As it is not a good practice to create a new IAM user for each user that signs up for the application, Option C is ruled out. Amazon Cognito user pools primary purpose is to authenticate and authorize web and mobile applications.

As the solution requires the application to store images that are between 300KB and 5MB in size, The idea of storing the images in the DynamoDB is ruled out because the object size in a dynamoDb table cannot exceed 400kb. The ideal solution for this problem would be to store the photos in S3 and store the object's key in the DynamoDB table.

So, Option B is the right answer

Highly Voted comment found!
Option C is the most scalable way to meet the requirements. This solution allows for a single SNS topic to be used for all partners, which minimizes the need for code changes when adding new partners. By publishing messages with specific attributes to the SNS topic and applying the appropriate filter policy to the topic subscriptions, partners will only receive notifications for their own orders. This approach allows for a more flexible and scalable solution, where new partners can be added to the system with minimal changes to the existing codebase. Option A and D may not be scalable when there are a large number of partners, as creating a separate SNS topic for each partner or subscribing all partners to a single topic may not be feasible. Option B may result in a large number of Lambda functions that need to be managed separately.

A financial company must store original customer records for 10 years for legal reasons. A complete record contains personally identifiable information (PII). According to local regulations, PII is available to only certain people in the company and must not be shared with third parties. The company needs to make the records available to third-party organizations for statistical analysis without sharing the PII.
A developer wants to store the original immutable record in Amazon S3. Depending on who accesses the S3 document, the document should be returned as is or with all the PII removed. The developer has written an AWS Lambda function to remove the PII from the document. The function is named removePii.
What should the developer do so that the company can meet the PII requirements while maintaining only one copy of the document?
A. Set up an S3 event notification that invokes the removePii function when an S3 GET request is made. Call Amazon S3 by using a GET request to access the object without PII.
B. Set up an S3 event notification that invokes the removePii function when an S3 PUT request is made. Call Amazon S3 by using a PUT request to access the object without PII.
C. Create an S3 Object Lambda access point from the S3 console. Select the removePii function. Use S3 Access Points to access the object without PII.
D. Create an S3 access point from the S3 console. Use the access point name to call the GetObjectLegalHold S3 API function. Pass in the removePii function name to access the object without PII.

A company is building a serverless application on AWS. The application uses an AWS Lambda function to process customer orders 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The Lambda function calls an external vendor's HTTP API to process payments.
During load tests, a developer discovers that the external vendor payment processing API occasionally times out and returns errors. The company expects that some payment processing API calls will return errors.
The company wants the support team to receive notifications in near real time only when the payment processing external API error rate exceed 5% of the total number of transactions in an hour. Developers need to use an existing Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic that is configured to notify the support team.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A. Write the results of payment processing API calls to Amazon CloudWatch. Use Amazon CloudWatch Logs Insights to query the CloudWatch logs. Schedule the Lambda function to check the CloudWatch logs and notify the existing SNS topic.
B. Publish custom metrics to CloudWatch that record the failures of the external payment processing API calls. Configure a CloudWatch alarm to notify the existing SNS topic when error rate exceeds the specified rate.
C. Publish the results of the external payment processing API calls to a new Amazon SNS topic. Subscribe the support team members to the new SNS topic.
D. Write the results of the external payment processing API calls to Amazon S3. Schedule an Amazon Athena query to run at regular intervals. Configure Athena to send notifications to the existing SNS topic when the error rate exceeds the specified rate.

B. Publish custom metrics to CloudWatch that record the failures of the external payment processing API calls. Configure a CloudWatch alarm to notify the existing SNS topic when the error rate exceeds the specified rate is the best solution to meet the requirements.

With CloudWatch custom metrics, developers can publish and monitor custom data points, including the number of failed requests to the external payment processing API. A CloudWatch alarm can be configured to notify an SNS topic when the error rate exceeds the specified rate, allowing the support team to be notified in near real-time.

Option A is not optimal since it involves scheduling a Lambda function to check the CloudWatch logs. Option C may not provide the desired functionality since it does not specify a rate at which to notify the support team. Option D is more complex than necessary, as it involves writing the results to S3 and configuring an Athena query to send notifications to an SNS topic.

B. Configure API Gateway to use an interface VPC endpoint.
C. Enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) for the APIs.
D. Configure usage plans and API keys in API Gateway.

Highly Voted comment found!
A. Enable API caching in API Gateway can help the company enhance the responsiveness of the APIs. By enabling caching, API Gateway stores the responses from the API and returns them for subsequent requests instead of forwarding the requests to Lambda. This reduces the number of requests to Lambda, improves API performance, and reduces latency for users.

A developer wants to store information about movies. Each movie has a title, release year, and genre. The movie information also can include additional properties about the cast and production crew. This additional information is inconsistent across movies. For example, one movie might have an assistant director, and another movie might have an animal trainer.
The developer needs to implement a solution to support the following use cases:
For a given title and release year, get all details about the movie that has that title and release year.
For a given title, get all details about all movies that have that title.
For a given genre, get all details about all movies in that genre.
Which data store configuration will meet these requirements?
A. Create an Amazon DynamoDB table. Configure the table with a primary key that consists of the title as the partition key and the release year as the sort key. Create a global secondary index that uses the genre as the partition key and the title as the sort key.
B. Create an Amazon DynamoDB table. Configure the table with a primary key that consists of the genre as the partition key and the release year as the sort key. Create a global secondary index that uses the title as the partition key.
C. On an Amazon RDS DB instance, create a table that contains columns for title, release year, and genre. Configure the title as the primary key.
D. On an Amazon RDS DB instance, create a table where the primary key is the title and all other data is encoded into JSON format as one additional column.

A. Create an Amazon DynamoDB table. Configure the table with a primary key that consists of the title as the partition key and the release year as the sort key. Create a global secondary index that uses the genre as the partition key and the title as the sort key.

This option is the best choice for the given requirements. By using DynamoDB, the developer can store the movie information in a flexible and scalable NoSQL database. The primary key can be set to the title and release year, allowing for efficient retrieval of information about a specific movie. The global secondary index can be created using the genre as the partition key, allowing for efficient retrieval of information about all movies in a specific genre.

A developer maintains an Amazon API Gateway REST API. Customers use the API through a frontend UI and Amazon Cognito authentication.
The developer has a new version of the API that contains new endpoints and backward-incompatible interface changes. The developer needs to provide beta access to other developers on the team without affecting customers.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?
A. Define a development stage on the API Gateway API. Instruct the other developers to point the endpoints to the development stage.
B. Define a new API Gateway API that points to the new API application code. Instruct the other developers to point the endpoints to the new API.
C. Implement a query parameter in the API application code that determines which code version to call.
D. Specify new API Gateway endpoints for the API endpoints that the developer wants to add.

Highly Voted comment found!
Option A is the correct solution to meet the requirements with the least operational overhead.

Defining a development stage on the API Gateway API enables other developers to test the new version of the API without affecting the production environment. This approach allows the developers to work on the new version of the API independently and avoid conflicts with the production environment.

The other options involve creating a new API or new endpoints, which could introduce additional operational overhead, such as managing multiple APIs or endpoints, configuring access control, and updating the frontend UI to point to the new endpoints or API. Option C also introduces additional complexity by requiring the implementation of a query parameter to determine which code version to call.

To meet the requirements of caching frequently accessed data while adding the ability to sort or rank cached datasets, a developer should choose Amazon ElastiCache for Redis. ElastiCache is a web service that provides an in-memory data store in the cloud, and it supports both Memcached and Redis engines. While both engines are suitable for caching frequently accessed data, Redis is a better choice for this use case because it provides sorted sets and other data structures that allow for sorting and ranking of cached datasets. The data in ElastiCache can be encrypted at rest and in transit, ensuring the security of the PHI. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.

A company has a multi-node Windows legacy application that runs on premises. The application uses a network shared folder as a centralized configuration repository to store configuration files in .xml format. The company is migrating the application to Amazon EC2 instances. As part of the migration to AWS, a developer must identify a solution that provides high availability for the repository.
Which solution will meet this requirement MOST cost-effectively?
A. Mount an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume onto one of the EC2 instances. Deploy a file system on the EBS volume. Use the host operating system to share a folder. Update the application code to read and write configuration files from the shared folder.
B. Deploy a micro EC2 instance with an instance store volume. Use the host operating system to share a folder. Update the application code to read and write configuration files from the shared folder.
C. Create an Amazon S3 bucket to host the repository. Migrate the existing .xml files to the S3 bucket. Update the application code to use the AWS SDK to read and write configuration files from Amazon S3.

Option C is the most cost-effective solution to provide high availability for the centralized configuration repository. Amazon S3 provides a highly durable and available object storage service. S3 stores objects redundantly across multiple devices and multiple facilities within a region, making it highly available. The developer can migrate the existing .xml files to an S3 bucket and update the application code to use the AWS SDK to read and write configuration files from Amazon S3.

Option A and B are not the best solutions as they require the developer to use the host operating system to share a folder, which can lead to a single point of failure.

Option D is not a recommended solution as it is not a direct way of accessing an S3 bucket. While it is possible to use third-party tools to mount an S3 bucket as a local disk, it can lead to performance issues and additional complexity.

The solution that will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead is option A: Host each website by using AWS Amplify with a serverless backend. AWS Amplify is a fully managed service that allows developers to build and deploy web applications and static websites. With Amplify, developers can easily connect their repositories, such as AWS CodeCommit, Bitbucket, and GitHub, to automatically build and deploy changes to the website based on code merges. Amplify also supports phased releases with multiple environments, including development, staging, user acceptance testing, and production, which can be linked to specific branches in the repository. Additionally, Amplify uses HTTPS for all data exchange by default and has a serverless backend, which means there are no servers to maintain. Overall, this solution provides the least operational overhead while meeting all the specified requirements.

I originally thought ElastiCache would provide the sufficient session management of the unique identifiers with the least latency. But apparently, the scope of this question revolves around durability, not latency. Hence, a persistent storage is better suited. And while RDS is a viable solution for durability and performance, the question specifies IoT devices which typically produce unstructured data that is better handled by No-SQL services like DynamoDB.

A developer wants to expand an application to run in multiple AWS Regions. The developer wants to copy Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) with the latest changes and create a new application stack in the destination Region. According to company requirements, all AMIs must be encrypted in all Regions. However, not all the AMIs that the company uses are encrypted.
How can the developer expand the application to run in the destination Region while meeting the encryption requirement?
A. Create new AMIs, and specify encryption parameters. Copy the encrypted AMIs to the destination Region. Delete the unencrypted AMIs.
B. Use AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) to enable encryption on the unencrypted AMIs. Copy the encrypted AMIs to the destination Region.
C. Use AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to enable encryption on the unencrypted AMIs. Copy the encrypted AMIs to the destination Region.
D. Copy the unencrypted AMIs to the destination Region. Enable encryption by default in the destination Region.

Highly Voted comment found!
A. Create new AMIs, and specify encryption parameters. Copy the encrypted AMIs to the destination Region. Delete the unencrypted AMIs.

The best solution for meeting the encryption requirement is to create new AMIs with encryption enabled and copy them to the destination Region. By default, when an AMI is copied to another Region, it is not encrypted in the destination Region even if it is encrypted in the source Region. Therefore, the developer must create new encrypted AMIs that can be used in the destination Region. Once the new encrypted AMIs have been created, they can be copied to the destination Region. The unencrypted AMIs can then be deleted to ensure that all instances running in all Regions are using only encrypted AMIs.

A developer has an application that stores data in an Amazon S3 bucket. The application uses an HTTP API to store and retrieve objects. When the PutObject API operation adds objects to the S3 bucket the developer must encrypt these objects at rest by using server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3).
Which solution will meet this requirement?
A. Create an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key. Assign the KMS key to the S3 bucket.

B. Set the x-amz-server-side-encryption header when invoking the PutObject API operation.

When using the PutObject API operation to store objects in an S3 bucket, the x-amz-server-side-encryption header can be set to specify the server-side encryption algorithm used to encrypt the object. Setting this header to "AES256" or "aws:kms" enables server-side encryption with SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS respectively.

Option A is incorrect because assigning a KMS key to the S3 bucket will not enable SSE-S3 encryption.

Option C is incorrect because providing the encryption key in the HTTP header of every request is not a valid way to enable SSE-S3 encryption.

Which AWS service or tool should the developer use to define serverless resources in YAML?
A. CloudFormation serverless intrinsic functions
B. AWS Elastic Beanstalk
C. AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM)
D. AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK)

Highly Voted comment found!
The recommended AWS service for defining serverless resources in YAML is the AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM).

AWS SAM is an open-source framework that extends AWS CloudFormation to provide a simplified way to define the Amazon API Gateway APIs, AWS Lambda functions, and Amazon DynamoDB tables needed by your serverless application. You can define your serverless resources in a YAML template and then use the AWS SAM CLI to package and deploy your application.

AWS CloudFormation serverless intrinsic functions can also be used to define serverless resources in YAML, but they have some limitations compared to AWS SAM. AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a platform as a service (PaaS) that is not serverless specific, while the AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) is an alternative to YAML-based templates that uses familiar programming languages like TypeScript, Python, and Java to define AWS infrastructure.

Which set of steps would be necessary to achieve this?
A. Create an event with Amazon EventBridge that will monitor the S3 bucket and then insert the records into DynamoDB.
B. Configure an S3 event to invoke an AWS Lambda function that inserts records into DynamoDB.
C. Create an AWS Lambda function that will poll the S3 bucket and then insert the records into DynamoDB.
D. Create a cron job that will run at a scheduled time and insert the records into DynamoDB.

Highly Voted comment found!
The correct answer is B.

To insert a record into DynamoDB as soon as a new file is added to an S3 bucket, you can configure an S3 event notification to invoke an AWS Lambda function that inserts the records into DynamoDB. When a new file is added to the S3 bucket, the S3 event notification will trigger the Lambda function, which will insert the record into the DynamoDB table.

Option A is incorrect because Amazon EventBridge is not necessary to achieve this. S3 event notifications can directly invoke a Lambda function to insert records into DynamoDB.

Option C is incorrect because polling the S3 bucket periodically to check for new files is inefficient and not necessary with S3 event notifications.

Option D is incorrect because running a cron job at a scheduled time is not real-time and would not insert the record into DynamoDB as soon as a new file is added to the S3 bucket.

A. Add a CloudFormation Deletion Policy attribute with the Retain value to the database resource: By adding a DeletionPolicy attribute with the Retain value to the database resource in the CloudFormation template, the database will not be deleted even if the CloudFormation stack is deleted. This helps prevent accidental database loss during stack deletion.

B. Update the CloudFormation stack policy to prevent updates to the database: By updating the CloudFormation stack policy, the development team can restrict updates to the database resource. This prevents accidental modifications or recreations of the database during stack updates. The stack policy can define specific actions that are allowed or denied, providing an additional layer of protection against unintentional database changes.

Both B and C are feasible solutions. Just consider the "MOST cost effectively" here.
AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store comes with no additional cost (Standard type). However, AWS Secrets Manager costs $0.40 per secret per month, and data retrieval costs $0.05 per 10,000 API calls.
C is much cheaper, guy.

ooooh this one was rough. I am going with A --> https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/connect-lambda-to-an-rds-instance

I was between A and C... wording for both tricky. But the only way C would work is if the last portion of the sentence the read "Add an inbound rule to SG2 to allow TCP traffic from port 3306" or "Add an outbound rule to SG1 to allow TCP traffic... "

An application uses an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group. A developer notices that EC2 instances are taking a long time to become available during scale-out events. The UserData script is taking a long time to run.
The developer must implement a solution to decrease the time that elapses before an EC2 instance becomes available. The solution must make the most recent version of the application available at all times and must apply all available security updates. The solution also must minimize the number of images that are created. The images must be validated.
Which combination of steps should the developer take to meet these requirements? (Choose two.)
A. Use EC2 Image Builder to create an Amazon Machine Image (AMI). Install all the patches and agents that are needed to manage and run the application. Update the Auto Scaling group launch configuration to use the AMI.
B. Use EC2 Image Builder to create an Amazon Machine Image (AMI). Install the latest version of the application and all the patches and agents that are needed to manage and run the application. Update the Auto Scaling group launch configuration to use the AMI.

D. Set up AWS CodePipeline to deploy the most recent version of the application at runtime.
E. Remove any commands that perform operating system patching from the UserData script.

Why choose A over B? Problem is that B will tie an AMI with a specific version, so if there is a new version, we need to create a new AMI, and that contradicts with "minimize the number of images that are created". 

Then E over C, D? E is obviously complementary to A, where removing commands from User Data will make the instance booting process much faster (and of course with A you don't need that anymore). 

C and D also works but 1/not complementary with any other options; 2/CodeDeploy takes time to execute. 

Hope this helps somebody struggling with this question.

Option E, which suggests removing operating system patching from the UserData script, might reduce the startup time. But this could leave your instances unpatched and vulnerable, which doesn't meet the requirement to apply all available security updates.

A developer needs to migrate an online retail application to AWS to handle an anticipated increase in traffic. The application currently runs on two servers: one server for the web application and another server for the database. The web server renders webpages and manages session state in memory. The database server hosts a MySQL database that contains order details. When traffic to the application is heavy, the memory usage for the web server approaches 100% and the application slows down considerably.
The developer has found that most of the memory increase and performance decrease is related to the load of managing additional user sessions. For the web server migration, the developer will use Amazon EC2 instances with an Auto Scaling group behind an Application Load Balancer.

A company needs to harden its container images before the images are in a running state. The company's application uses Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) as an image registry. Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) for compute, and an AWS CodePipeline pipeline that orchestrates a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) workflow.
Dynamic application security testing occurs in the final stage of the pipeline after a new image is deployed to a development namespace in the EKS cluster. A developer needs to place an analysis stage before this deployment to analyze the container image earlier in the CI/CD pipeline.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the MOST operational efficiency?
A. Build the container image and run the docker scan command locally. Mitigate any findings before pushing changes to the source code repository. Write a pre-commit hook that enforces the use of this workflow before commit.

This approach integrates security scanning directly into the CI/CD pipeline and leverages AWS services for image scanning. Here's how it works:

A new CodePipeline stage is added after the container image is built, but before it's pushed to Amazon ECR.

ECR basic image scanning is configured to scan the image automatically upon push. This ensures that security scanning is part of the process.

An AWS Lambda function is used as an action provider in the pipeline. This Lambda function can be configured to analyze the scan results of the image.

If the Lambda function detects any security findings in the scan results, it can fail the pipeline, preventing the deployment of images with security vulnerabilities.

A developer is testing a new file storage application that uses an Amazon CloudFront distribution to serve content from an Amazon S3 bucket. The distribution accesses the S3 bucket by using an origin access identity (OAI). The S3 bucket's permissions explicitly deny access to all other users.
The application prompts users to authenticate on a login page and then uses signed cookies to allow users to access their personal storage directories. The developer has configured the distribution to use its default cache behavior with restricted viewer access and has set the origin to point to the S3 bucket. However, when the developer tries to navigate to the login page, the developer receives a 403 Forbidden error.
The developer needs to implement a solution to allow unauthenticated access to the login page. The solution also must keep all private content secure.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A. Add a second cache behavior to the distribution with the same origin as the default cache behavior. Set the path pattern for the second cache behavior to the path of the login page, and make viewer access unrestricted. Keep the default cache behavior's settings unchanged.
B. Add a second cache behavior to the distribution with the same origin as the default cache behavior. Set the path pattern for the second cache behavior to *, and make viewer access restricted. Change the default cache behavior's path pattern to the path of the login page, and make viewer access unrestricted.
C. Add a second origin as a failover origin to the default cache behavior. Point the failover origin to the S3 bucket. Set the path pattern for the primary origin to *, and make viewer access restricted. Set the path pattern for the failover origin to the path of the login page, and make viewer access unrestricted.
D. Add a bucket policy to the S3 bucket to allow read access. Set the resource on the policy to the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the login page object in the S3 bucket. Add a CloudFront function to the default cache behavior to redirect unauthorized requests to the login page's S3 URL.

When Lambda functions are invoked asynchronously, there is a possibility that the function fails without logging errors if there is no proper error handling. Configuring a dead-letter queue (DLQ) allows you to capture and review events that were not processed successfully. By creating and inspecting the DLQ, you can identify and troubleshoot the issues with the failed Lambda invocations and reprocess those events if needed. This will help ensure that no orders are missed without leaving any errors in the Lambda logs.

Exam AWS Certified Developer - Associate DVA-C02 topic 1 question 61 discussion - March 25, 2023, 11:52 p.m.
A company is building a web application on AWS. When a customer sends a request, the application will generate reports and then make the reports available to the customer within one hour. Reports should be accessible to the customer for 8 hours. Some reports are larger than 1 MB. Each report is unique to the customer. The application should delete all reports that are older than 2 days.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?
A. Generate the reports and then store the reports as Amazon DynamoDB items that have a specified TTL. Generate a URL that retrieves the reports from DynamoDB. Provide the URL to customers through the web application.
B. Generate the reports and then store the reports in an Amazon S3 bucket that uses server-side encryption. Attach the reports to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) message. Subscribe the customer to email notifications from Amazon SNS.
C. Generate the reports and then store the reports in an Amazon S3 bucket that uses server-side encryption. Generate a presigned URL that contains an expiration date Provide the URL to customers through the web application. Add S3 Lifecycle configuration rules to the S3 bucket to delete old reports.
D. Generate the reports and then store the reports in an Amazon RDS database with a date stamp. Generate an URL that retrieves the reports from the RDS database. Provide the URL to customers through the web application. Schedule an hourly AWS Lambda function to delete database records that have expired date stamps.

Highly Voted comment found!
Explanation: Storing the reports in an Amazon S3 bucket provides a cost-effective and scalable solution for handling files larger than 1 MB. Server-side encryption ensures data security. Generating a presigned URL with an expiration date allows the customer to access the report for 8 hours, and S3 Lifecycle configuration rules automatically delete the reports older than 2 days, reducing operational overhead.

A company has deployed an application on AWS Elastic Beanstalk. The company has configured the Auto Scaling group that is associated with the Elastic Beanstalk environment to have five Amazon EC2 instances. If the capacity is fewer than four EC2 instances during the deployment, application performance degrades. The company is using the all-at-once deployment policy.
What is the MOST cost-effective way to solve the deployment issue?
A. Change the Auto Scaling group to six desired instances.
B. Change the deployment policy to traffic splitting. Specify an evaluation time of 1 hour.
C. Change the deployment policy to rolling with additional batch. Specify a batch size of 1.
D. Change the deployment policy to rolling. Specify a batch size of 2.

Highly Voted comment found!
Explanation: The rolling with additional batch deployment policy allows Elastic Beanstalk to launch additional instances in a new batch before terminating the old instances. In this case, specifying a batch size of 1 means that Elastic Beanstalk will deploy the application updates to 1 new instance at a time, ensuring that there are always at least 4 instances available during the deployment process. This method maintains application performance while minimizing the additional cost.
******************************
Highly Voted comment found!
1. Rolling with additional batch deployment: This type of deployment maintains full capacity while new application versions are deployed. It launches a new batch of instances with the new application version, and if the new batch is healthy, it terminates a batch of instances running the old application version.

2. Batch size of 1: This will ensure that one new instance is launched with the new version of the application. Once it is deemed healthy, one of the old instances will be terminated. This will continue until all instances are running the new version, ensuring the capacity is never less than four instances. This approach will add only a minimal additional cost for the temporary overlapping instances during deployment.

A developer is migrating some features from a legacy monolithic application to use AWS Lambda functions instead. The application currently stores data in an Amazon Aurora DB cluster that runs in private subnets in a VPC. The AWS account has one VPC deployed. The Lambda functions and the DB cluster are deployed in the same AWS Region in the same AWS account.
The developer needs to ensure that the Lambda functions can securely access the DB cluster without crossing the public internet.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A. Configure the DB cluster's public access setting to Yes.
B. Configure an Amazon RDS database proxy for he Lambda functions.
C. Configure a NAT gateway and a security group for the Lambda functions.
D. Configure the VPC, subnets, and a security group for the Lambda functions.

Highly Voted comment found!
Option D is the right answer. When we want the lambda to privately access the DB cluster instead of moving the traffic over the public internet, we need to have the lambda and db cluster to be in the same VPC.

When we configure the VPC, subnets, and a security group for the lambda function, the lambda function will be able to communicate with the db cluster using the private IPs that are associated to the VPC.

NAT gateway comes into use when you have the lambda deployed in a private subnet and you would want to provide internet access to it.
******************************
Highly Voted comment found!
Explanation: To securely access the Amazon Aurora DB cluster without crossing the public internet, the Lambda functions need to be configured to run within the same VPC as the DB cluster. This involves configuring the VPC, subnets, and a security group for the Lambda functions. This setup ensures that the Lambda functions can communicate with the DB cluster using private IP addresses within the VPC.

A developer is configuring an application's deployment environment in AWS CodePipeline. The application code is stored in a GitHub repository. The developer wants to ensure that the repository package's unit tests run in the new deployment environment. The developer has already set the pipeline's source provider to GitHub and has specified the repository and branch to use in the deployment.
Which combination of steps should the developer take next to meet these requirements with the LEAST overhead? (Choose two.)
A. Create an AWS CodeCommit project. Add the repository package's build and test commands to the project's buildspec.
B. Create an AWS CodeBuild project. Add the repository package's build and test commands to the project's buildspec.
C. Create an AWS CodeDeploy project. Add the repository package's build and test commands to the project's buildspec.
D. Add an action to the source stage. Specify the newly created project as the action provider. Specify the build artifact as the action's input artifact.
E. Add a new stage to the pipeline after the source stage. Add an action to the new stage. Specify the newly created project as the action provider. Specify the source artifact as the action's input artifact.

Highly Voted comment found!
The correct answer is B and E
The buildspec file is a collection of build commands and related settings, in YAML format, that CodeBuild uses to run a build. By adding the build and test commands to the buildspec file, the developer can ensure that these commands are executed as part of the build process. Option E will ensure that the CodeBuild project is triggered as part of the pipeline and that the unit tests are run in the new deployment environment.

A developer is creating a Ruby application and needs to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of an environment without requiring knowledge of the underlying infrastructure.
Which service would best accomplish this task?
A. AWS CodeDeploy
B. AWS CloudFormation
C. AWS OpsWorks
D. AWS Elastic Beanstalk

Highly Voted comment found!
answer- d
AWS CodeDeploy can automate the deployment of code to any instance, including Amazon EC2 instances and on-premises servers. However, it does not provide the same level of automation as Elastic Beanstalk, and it requires more manual intervention from developers.
AWS CloudFormation can help you model and set up your AWS resources. However, it does not provide any automation for deploying or managing applications.
AWS OpsWorks is a configuration management service that provides managed instances of Chef and Puppet. However, it is not as easy to use as Elastic Beanstalk, and it does not provide the same level of automation for deploying or managing applications.

A company has a web application that is deployed on AWS. The application uses an Amazon API Gateway API and an AWS Lambda function as its backend.
The application recently demonstrated unexpected behavior. A developer examines the Lambda function code, finds an error, and modifies the code to resolve the problem. Before deploying the change to production, the developer needs to run tests to validate that the application operates properly.
The application has only a production environment available. The developer must create a new development environment to test the code changes. The developer must also prevent other developers from overwriting these changes during the test cycle.
Which combination of steps will meet these requirements with the LEAST development effort? (Choose two.)
A. Create a new resource in the current stage. Create a new method with Lambda proxy integration. Select the Lambda function. Add the hotfix alias. Redeploy the current stage. Test the backend.
B. Update the Lambda function in the API Gateway API integration request to use the hotfix alias. Deploy the API Gateway API to a new stage named hotfix. Test the backend.
C. Modify the Lambda function by fixing the code. Test the Lambda function. Create the alias hotfix. Point the alias to the $LATEST version.
D. Modify the Lambda function by fixing the code. Test the Lambda function. When the Lambda function is working as expected, publish the Lambda function as a new version. Create the alias hotfix. Point the alias to the new version.
E. Create a new API Gateway API for the development environment. Add a resource and method with Lambda integration. Choose the Lambda function and the hotfix alias. Deploy to a new stage. Test the backend.

C. Each day, create a new table to hold session data; delete the previous day's table.
D. Add an attribute with the expiration time; name the attribute ItemExpiration.

Highly Voted comment found!
The simplest way to automatically delete old items from an Amazon DynamoDB table is to use DynamoDB's Time to Live (TTL) feature. This feature allows you to define an attribute that stores the expiration time for each item. Once the specified time has passed, DynamoDB automatically deletes the expired items, freeing up storage and reducing costs without the need for custom scripts or manual intervention.

A company moved some of its secure files to a private Amazon S3 bucket that has no public access. The company wants to develop a serverless application that gives its employees the ability to log in and securely share the files with other users.
Which AWS feature should the company use to share and access the files securely?
A. Amazon Cognito user pool
B. S3 presigned URLs
C. S3 bucket policy
D. Amazon Cognito identity pool

Highly Voted comment found!
Employees log into the serverless application using an Amazon Cognito User Pool.
Once logged in, the application's back-end logic (possibly a Lambda function) generates an S3 pre-signed URL for the requested file.
The pre-signed URL is then given to the authenticated user, allowing them secure, time-limited access to that specific S3 object.
So, while both Amazon Cognito User Pool and S3 Pre-signed URLs would be used in the solution, S3 Pre-signed URLs (Option B) are the specific feature that allows for the secure, temporary sharing of S3 files. 
Therefore, Option B would be the best answer to the question of how to "share and access the files securely."

A developer has designed an application to store incoming data as JSON files in Amazon S3 objects. Custom business logic in an AWS Lambda function then transforms the objects, and the Lambda function loads the data into an Amazon DynamoDB table. Recently, the workload has experienced sudden and significant changes in traffic. The flow of data to the DynamoDB table is becoming throttled.
The developer needs to implement a solution to eliminate the throttling and load the data into the DynamoDB table more consistently.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A. Refactor the Lambda function into two functions. Configure one function to transform the data and one function to load the data into the DynamoDB table. Create an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue in between the functions to hold the items as messages and to invoke the second function.
B. Turn on auto scaling for the DynamoDB table. Use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor the table's read and write capacity metrics and to track consumed capacity.
C. Create an alias for the Lambda function. Configure provisioned concurrency for the application to use.
D. Refactor the Lambda function into two functions. Configure one function to store the data in the DynamoDB table. Configure the second function to process the data and update the items after the data is stored in DynamoDB. Create a DynamoDB stream to invoke the second function after the data is stored.

A. Refactor the Lambda function into two functions. Configure one function to transform the data and one function to load the data into the DynamoDB table. Create an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue in between the functions to hold the items as messages and to invoke the second function.

By breaking the Lambda function into two separate functions and using an SQS queue to hold the transformed data as messages, you can decouple the data transformation and loading processes. This allows for more controlled loading of data into the DynamoDB table and helps eliminate throttling issues.
******************************
Highly Voted comment found!
This solution will allow the developer to store the incoming data into the DynamoDB table more consistently without being throttled. By splitting the Lambda function into two functions, the first function can store the data into the DynamoDB table and exit quickly, avoiding any throttling issues. The second function can then process the data and update the items after the data is stored in DynamoDB using a DynamoDB stream to invoke the second function.
Option A is also a good option but not the best solution because it introduces additional complexity and cost by using an Amazon SQS queue.

A developer is creating an AWS Lambda function in VPC mode. An Amazon S3 event will invoke the Lambda function when an object is uploaded into an S3 bucket. The Lambda function will process the object and produce some analytic results that will be recorded into a file. Each processed object will also generate a log entry that will be recorded into a file.
Other Lambda functions, AWS services, and on-premises resources must have access to the result files and log file. Each log entry must also be appended to the same shared log file. The developer needs a solution that can share files and append results into an existing file.
Which solution should the developer use to meet these requirements?
A. Create an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system. Mount the EFS file system in Lambda. Store the result files and log file in the mount point. Append the log entries to the log file.
B. Create an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) Multi-Attach enabled volume. Attach the EBS volume to all Lambda functions. Update the Lambda function code to download the log file, append the log entries, and upload the modified log file to Amazon EBS.
C. Create a reference to the /tmp local directory. Store the result files and log file by using the directory reference. Append the log entry to the log file.
D. Create a reference to the /opt storage directory. Store the result files and log file by using the directory reference. Append the log entry to the log file.

The requirement is to have a shared file system that allows for appending to files and can be accessed by multiple Lambda functions, AWS services, and on-premises resources. Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) is a good fit for these requirements. EFS provides a scalable and elastic NFS file system which can be mounted to multiple EC2 instances and Lambda functions at the same time, making it easier for these resources to share files. You can also append to existing files on an EFS file system, which meets the requirement for a shared log file that can have new entries appended to it.

A social media application uses the AWS SDK for JavaScript on the frontend to get user credentials from AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS). The application stores its assets in an Amazon S3 bucket. The application serves its content by using an Amazon CloudFront distribution with the origin set to the S3 bucket.
The credentials for the role that the application assumes to make the SDK calls are stored in plaintext in a JSON file within the application code. The developer needs to implement a solution that will allow the application to get user credentials without having any credentials hardcoded in the application code.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A. Add a Lambda@Edge function to the distribution. Invoke the function on viewer request. Add permissions to the function's execution role to allow the function to access AWS STS. Move all SDK calls from the frontend into the function.
B. Add a CloudFront function to the distribution. Invoke the function on viewer request. Add permissions to the function's execution role to allow the function to access AWS STS. Move all SDK calls from the frontend into the function.
C. Add a Lambda@Edge function to the distribution. Invoke the function on viewer request. Move the credentials from the JSON file into the function. Move all SDK calls from the frontend into the function.
D. Add a CloudFront function to the distribution. Invoke the function on viewer request. Move the credentials from the JSON file into the function. Move all SDK calls from the frontend into the function.

Highly Voted comment found!
The answer is A. Here is a reference directly from AWS docs:

"If you need some of the capabilities of Lambda@Edge that are not available with CloudFront Functions, such as network access or a longer execution time, you can still use Lambda@Edge before and after content is cached by CloudFront."

Since the requirement is to access the STS service, network access is required. Therefore, it can't be Cloudfront functions. Also, as a side note it's worth to mention that Cloudfront functions can only execute for up to 1ms. Apparently this isn't enough to fetch user creds (tokens) from STS. 

The table in the following link summarises the differences between Cloudfront functions and Lambda@edge

B. Create an Amazon Cognito identity pool. Configure the identity pool to allow unauthenticated users. Exchange unique identity for temporary credentials that allow all users to assume a role.
C. Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution. Configure the distribution to allow unauthenticated users. Exchange user tokens for temporary credentials that allow all users to assume a role.
D. Create a role for authenticated users that allows access to all content. Create a role for unauthenticated users that allows access to only the sample content.
E. Allow all users to access the sample content by default. Create a role for authenticated users that allows access to the other content.

Highly Voted comment found!
option B because by configuring the identity pool to allow unauthenticated users, you can enable guest users to access the sample content. When users create an account, they can be authenticated, and then given access to the full content by assuming a role that allows them access.
Option D is correct because creating roles for authenticated and unauthenticated users with different levels of access is an appropriate way to meet the requirement of identifying users who have created an account and keeping track of the number of guest users who eventually create an account.

A company has an image storage web application that runs on AWS. The company hosts the application on Amazon EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group. The Auto Scaling group acts as the target group for an Application Load Balancer (ALB) and uses an Amazon S3 bucket to store the images for sale.
The company wants to develop a feature to test system requests. The feature will direct requests to a separate target group that hosts a new beta version of the application.
Which solution will meet this requirement with the LEAST effort?
A. Create a new Auto Scaling group and target group for the beta version of the application. Update the ALB routing rule with a condition that looks for a cookie named version that has a value of beta. Update the test system code to use this cookie to test the beta version of the application.
B. Create a new ALB, Auto Scaling group, and target group for the beta version of the application. Configure an alternate Amazon Route 53 record for the new ALB endpoint. Use the alternate Route 53 endpoint in the test system requests to test the beta version of the application.
C. Create a new ALB, Auto Scaling group, and target group for the beta version of the application. Use Amazon CloudFront with Lambda@Edge to determine which specific request will go to the new ALB. Use the CloudFront endpoint to send the test system requests to test the beta version of the application.
D. Create a new Auto Scaling group and target group for the beta version of the application. Update the ALB routing rule with a condition that looks for a cookie named version that has a value of beta. Use Amazon CloudFront with Lambda@Edge to update the test system requests to add the required cookie when the requests go to the ALB.

Highly Voted comment found!
This solution will allow the company to direct requests to a separate target group that hosts the new beta version of the application without having to create a new ALB or use additional services such as Amazon Route 53 or Amazon CloudFront. 
Option D adds additional complexity and effort compared to option A, which simply involves updating the ALB routing rule with a condition that looks for a cookie named version that has a value of beta and updating the test system code to use this cookie to test the beta version of the application.

Highly Voted comment found!
The best caching strategy for populating real-time dashboards using Amazon ElastiCache would be a write-through caching strategy. In this strategy, when new data is written to the database, it is also written to the cache. This ensures that the most current data is always available in the cache for the real-time dashboards to access, reducing the latency of the data retrieval. Additionally, using a write-through cache ensures that data consistency is maintained between the database and the cache, as any changes to the data are written to both locations simultaneously.

C. Perform an immutable update to deploy the new application code to new EC2 instances. Serve traffic to the new instances after they pass health checks.
D. Use a rolling deployment for the new application code. Apply the code to a subset of EC2 instances until the tests pass. Redeploy the previous code if the tests fail.

Highly Voted comment found!
Option C is the correct solution that meets the requirements. Performing an immutable update to deploy the new application code to new EC2 instances and serving traffic to the new instances after they pass health checks will ensure zero downtime for the application.

Option A would work but cloning the production environment to a different platform version will result in a longer deployment time and can impact the cost of the environment.

Exam AWS Certified Developer - Associate DVA-C02 topic 1 question 129 discussion - June 17, 2023, 6:32 a.m.
A developer is creating an AWS Lambda function. The Lambda function will consume messages from an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. The developer wants to integrate unit testing as part of the function's continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) process.
How can the developer unit test the function?
A. Create an AWS CloudFormation template that creates an SQS queue and deploys the Lambda function. Create a stack from the template during the CI/CD process. Invoke the deployed function. Verify the output.
B. Create an SQS event for tests. Use a test that consumes messages from the SQS queue during the function's Cl/CD process.
C. Create an SQS queue for tests. Use this SQS queue in the application's unit test. Run the unit tests during the CI/CD process.
D. Use the aws lambda invoke command with a test event during the CIICD process.

Highly Voted comment found!
Unit testing is a type of testing that verifies the correctness of individual units of source code, typically functions or methods. When unit testing a Lambda function that interacts with Amazon SQS, you can create a separate test SQS queue that the Lambda function interacts with during testing. You would then validate the behavior of the function based on its interactions with the test queue. This approach isolates the function's behavior from the rest of the system, which is a key principle of unit testing.

Option A is incorrect because AWS CloudFormation is typically used for infrastructure deployment, not for unit testing.

Option B is incorrect because it does not actually test the function; it only creates an event.

Option D is incorrect because the 'aws lambda invoke' command is used to manually trigger a Lambda function, but doesn't necessarily facilitate testing the function's behavior when consuming messages from an SQS queue.
******************************
Highly Voted comment found!
D is correct here. Both B and C are integration tests as they are using an actual SQS queue in the tests and not mocking it out.

A developer creates an AWS Lambda function that retrieves and groups data from several public API endpoints. The Lambda function has been updated and configured to connect to the private subnet of a VPC. An internet gateway is attached to the VPC. The VPC uses the default network ACL and security group configurations.
The developer finds that the Lambda function can no longer access the public API. The developer has ensured that the public API is accessible, but the Lambda function cannot connect to the API
How should the developer fix the connection issue?
A. Ensure that the network ACL allows outbound traffic to the public internet.
B. Ensure that the security group allows outbound traffic to the public internet.
C. Ensure that outbound traffic from the private subnet is routed to a public NAT gateway.
D. Ensure that outbound traffic from the private subnet is routed to a new internet gateway.

Highly Voted comment found!
When a Lambda function is configured to connect to a VPC, it loses its default internet access. To allow the Lambda function to access the public internet, it must be connected to a private subnet in the VPC that is configured to route its traffic through a NAT Gateway (Network Address Translation Gateway).

The Internet Gateway is usually used to provide internet access to resources in the public subnet, but for resources in the private subnet, a NAT Gateway is required.

A developer who was working on one of the tasks did not pull the most recent changes from the main branch. A week later, the developer noticed merge conflicts.
How can the developer resolve the merge conflicts in the developer's branch with the LEAST development effort?
A. Clone the repository. Create a new branch. Update the branch with the changes.
B. Create a new branch. Apply the changes from the previous branch.
C. Use the Commit Visualizer view to compare the commits when a feature was added. Fix the merge conflicts.
D. Stop the pull from the main branch to the feature branch. Rebase the feature branch from the main branch.

Highly Voted comment found!
Option D is the best approach for resolving the merge conflicts with minimal development effort. Here's how it works:

Stop Pull from Main: By stopping the pull from the main branch to the feature branch, the developer can prevent the introduction of new conflicts while they are resolving the existing ones.

Rebase the Feature Branch: After stopping the pull, the developer can rebase the feature branch onto the main branch. This essentially replays the feature branch's changes on top of the main branch's latest changes. This allows the developer to resolve conflicts one commit at a time, addressing any conflicts that arise from the difference between the feature branch and the main branch.

An online food company provides an Amazon API Gateway HTTP API to receive orders for partners. The API is integrated with an AWS Lambda function. The Lambda function stores the orders in an Amazon DynamoDB table.
The company expects to onboard additional partners. Some of the partners require additional Lambda functions to receive orders. The company has created an Amazon S3 bucket. The company needs to store all orders and updates in the S3 bucket for future analysis.
How can the developer ensure that all orders and updates are stored to Amazon S3 with the LEAST development effort?
A. Create a new Lambda function and a new API Gateway API endpoint. Configure the new Lambda function to write to the S3 bucket. Modify the original Lambda function to post updates to the new API endpoint.
B. Use Amazon Kinesis Data Streams to create a new data stream. Modify the Lambda function to publish orders to the data stream. Configure the data stream to write to the S3 bucket.
C. Enable DynamoDB Streams on the DynamoDB table. Create a new Lambda function. Associate the stream’s Amazon Resource Name (ARN) with the Lambda function. Configure the Lambda function to write to the S3 bucket as records appear in the table's stream.
D. Modify the Lambda function to publish to a new Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic as the Lambda function receives orders. Subscribe a new Lambda function to the topic. Configure the new Lambda function to write to the S3 bucket as updates come through the topic.

Highly Voted comment found!
By enabling DynamoDB Streams on the DynamoDB table, you can capture changes (orders and updates) to the table. Whenever a new order or an update is made to the table, a stream record is generated. You can then create a new Lambda function, associate the stream's ARN with this Lambda function, and configure it to write the stream records (orders and updates) to the S3 bucket. This approach leverages built-in features of DynamoDB and Lambda, minimizing the development effort required to achieve the desired outcome.

Asymmetric keys (option C) are typically used for different use cases, such as digital signatures and key pairs, and may not be as suitable for automatic rotation in the described scenario.

Imported key material (option D) means that you bring your own key material, and AWS KMS doesn't support automatic rotation for such keys.

Amazon S3 managed keys (option A) are used specifically for Amazon S3 and don't support automatic rotation.

This is the most efficient and integrated approach. AWS CodeBuild is fully integrated with AWS CodePipeline and can be used to run unit tests as part of the CI/CD process. Placing the testing stage before deployment ensures that only tested code is deployed. The buildspec can be configured to fail the build if tests do not pass, and CodeBuild's test reports feature allows for easy viewing and analysis of test results.

A company has multiple Amazon VPC endpoints in the same VPC. A developer needs to configure an Amazon S3 bucket policy so users can access an S3 bucket only by using these VPC endpoints.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A. Create multiple S3 bucket polices by using each VPC endpoint ID that have the aws:SourceVpce value in the StringNotEquals condition.
B. Create a single S3 bucket policy that has the aws:SourceVpc value and in the StringNotEquals condition to use VPC ID.
C. Create a single S3 bucket policy that has the aws:SourceVpce value and in the StringNotEquals condition to use vpce*.
D. Create a single S3 bucket policy that has multiple aws:sourceVpce value in the StringNotEquals condition. Repeat for all the VPC endpoint IDs.

A company uses a custom root certificate authority certificate chain (Root CA Cert) that is 10 KB in size to generate SSL certificates for its on-premises HTTPS endpoints. One of the company’s cloud-based applications has hundreds of AWS Lambda functions that pull data from these endpoints. A developer updated the trust store of the Lambda execution environment to use the Root CA Cert when the Lambda execution environment is initialized. The developer bundled the Root CA Cert as a text file in the Lambda deployment bundle.
After 3 months of development, the Root CA Cert is no longer valid and must be updated. The developer needs a more efficient solution to update the Root CA Cert for all deployed Lambda functions. The solution must not include rebuilding or updating all Lambda functions that use the Root CA Cert. The solution must also work for all development, testing, and production environments. Each environment is managed in a separate AWS account.
Which combination of steps should the developer take to meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively? (Choose two.)
A. Store the Root CA Cert as a secret in AWS Secrets Manager. Create a resource-based policy. Add IAM users to allow access to the secret.
B. Store the Root CA Cert as a SecureString parameter in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store. Create a resource-based policy. Add IAM users to allow access to the policy.
C. Store the Root CA Cert in an Amazon S3 bucket. Create a resource-based policy to allow access to the bucket.
D. Refactor the Lambda code to load the Root CA Cert from the Root CA Cert’s location. Modify the runtime trust store inside the Lambda function handler.
E. Refactor the Lambda code to load the Root CA Cert from the Root CA Cert’s location. Modify the runtime trust store outside the Lambda function handler.

A developer migrated a legacy application to an AWS Lambda function. The function uses a third-party service to pull data with a series of API calls at the end of each month. The function then processes the data to generate the monthly reports. The function has been working with no issues so far.
The third-party service recently issued a restriction to allow a fixed number of API calls each minute and each day. If the API calls exceed the limit for each minute or each day, then the service will produce errors. The API also provides the minute limit and daily limit in the response header. This restriction might extend the overall process to multiple days because the process is consuming more API calls than the available limit.
What is the MOST operationally efficient way to refactor the serverless application to accommodate this change?
A. Use an AWS Step Functions state machine to monitor API failures. Use the Wait state to delay calling the Lambda function.
B. Use an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue to hold the API calls. Configure the Lambda function to poll the queue within the API threshold limits.
C. Use an Amazon CloudWatch Logs metric to count the number of API calls. Configure an Amazon CloudWatch alarm that stops the currently running instance of the Lambda function when the metric exceeds the API threshold limits.

The immutable method strikes a balance between maintaining service availability and controlling costs. It avoids the downtime associated with the all-at-once method and doesn't require the more extensive resource duplication of the blue/green method. While it does temporarily increase resource usage (similar to rolling with an additional batch), it's generally more efficient and less risky than updating instances in-place.

A developer at a company recently created a serverless application to process and show data from business reports. The application’s user interface (UI) allows users to select and start processing the files. The UI displays a message when the result is available to view. The application uses AWS Step Functions with AWS Lambda functions to process the files. The developer used Amazon API Gateway and Lambda functions to create an API to support the UI.
The company’s UI team reports that the request to process a file is often returning timeout errors because of the size or complexity of the files. The UI team wants the API to provide an immediate response so that the UI can display a message while the files are being processed. The backend process that is invoked by the API needs to send an email message when the report processing is complete.
What should the developer do to configure the API to meet these requirements?
A. Change the API Gateway route to add an X-Amz-Invocation-Type header with a static value of ‘Event’ in the integration request. Deploy the API Gateway stage to apply the changes.
B. Change the configuration of the Lambda function that implements the request to process a file. Configure the maximum age of the event so that the Lambda function will run asynchronously.
C. Change the API Gateway timeout value to match the Lambda function timeout value. Deploy the API Gateway stage to apply the changes.
D. Change the API Gateway route to add an X-Amz-Target header with a static value of ‘Async’ in the integration request. Deploy the API Gateway stage to apply the changes.

Highly Voted comment found!
Change the API Gateway route to add an X-Amz-Invocation-Type header with a static value of ‘Event’ in the integration request: This is the correct approach. By setting the X-Amz-Invocation-Type header to Event in the API Gateway integration request, the API Gateway will invoke the Lambda function asynchronously. In asynchronous execution, the Lambda function returns an immediate response (202 or Accepted status) to API Gateway, which can then relay it back to the UI. Meanwhile, the Lambda function processes the file in the background.

Which solutions will mitigate this error MOST cost-effectively? (Choose two.)
A. Modify the application code to perform exponential backoff when the error is received.
B. Modify the application to use the AWS SDKs for DynamoDB.
C. Increase the read and write throughput of the DynamoDB table.
D. Create a DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) cluster for the DynamoDB table.
E. Create a second DynamoDB table. Distribute the reads and writes between the two tables.

Highly Voted comment found!
A. Modify the application code to perform exponential backoff when the error is received: This is a cost-effective and recommended approach. Exponential backoff is a standard error-retry strategy where the time between retries gradually increases. This strategy helps to efficiently manage request retries without immediately consuming additional throughput, thus reducing the likelihood of repeatedly hitting the throughput limits.

B. Modify the application to use the AWS SDKs for DynamoDB: The AWS SDKs implement best practices, including automatic retry logic with exponential backoff. Using an AWS SDK for DynamoDB can simplify the implementation and is more efficient than directly calling the DynamoDB REST API. This change can help mitigate throughput exceedance errors.

A company has an application that runs as a series of AWS Lambda functions. Each Lambda function receives data from an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic and writes the data to an Amazon Aurora DB instance.
To comply with an information security policy, the company must ensure that the Lambda functions all use a single securely encrypted database connection string to access Aurora.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A. Use IAM database authentication for Aurora to enable secure database connections for all the Lambda functions.
B. Store the credentials and read the credentials from an encrypted Amazon RDS DB instance.
C. Store the credentials in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store as a secure string parameter.
D. Use Lambda environment variables with a shared AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key for encryption.

Highly Voted comment found!
C.
AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store offers a more centralized way to manage encrypted secrets across multiple services than Lambda environment variables, making it a better fit for this scenario.
******************************
Highly Voted comment found!
C.
Option A (IAM database authentication) may provide secure authentication, but it doesn't directly address the storage and retrieval of the connection string.

Option B (storing credentials in an encrypted RDS DB instance) might introduce unnecessary complexity and potential security risks.

Option D (Lambda environment variables with a shared AWS KMS key) is a viable option, but using Parameter Store is generally considered a more centralized and managed approach for storing and retrieving sensitive data in AWS.

Therefore, option C is the most appropriate choice for securely managing the database connection string in this scenario.

D. Use Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda to control access to an S3 bucket.

Highly Voted comment found!
A. Use Amazon CloudFront with signed URLs for Amazon S3.

Using Amazon CloudFront with signed URLs is a secure and cost-effective way to control access to downloads. With signed URLs, you can generate URLs with limited time validity, ensuring that only users with the correct URL and during the specified time window can access the firmware updates. This provides both security and control over access.

Option B (Create a dedicated Amazon CloudFront Distribution for each customer) may result in higher costs and increased complexity. Option C (Use Amazon CloudFront with AWS Lambda@Edge) is more focused on customization and additional processing at the edge locations, which may not be necessary for simple access control. Option D (Use Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda) is more suited for managing APIs and might be an overkill for a straightforward firmware update distribution scenario.

To set up deployments to multiple environments with the least development effort in a serverless application using the AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM), the developer can utilize a configuration file in TOML format with grouped configuration entries for each environment. This approach allows for easy management of different environment configurations and streamlines the deployment process. The specific steps would include:

Creating a configuration file in TOML format: This file will include a table for each testing and staging environment, where each table contains the specific configuration for that environment.
Using the sam deploy command with the --config-env flag: This flag allows specifying which environment configuration to use for the deployment, corresponding to the tables defined in the configuration file.

A developer is working on an application that processes operating data from IoT devices. Each IoT device uploads a data file once every hour to an Amazon S3 bucket. The developer wants to immediately process each data file when the data file is uploaded to Amazon S3.
The developer will use an AWS Lambda function to process the data files from Amazon S3. The Lambda function is configured with the S3 bucket information where the files are uploaded. The developer wants to configure the Lambda function to immediately invoke after each data file is uploaded.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A. Add an asynchronous invocation to the Lambda function. Select the S3 bucket as the source.
B. Add an Amazon EventBridge event to the Lambda function. Select the S3 bucket as the source.
C. Add a trigger to the Lambda function. Select the S3 bucket as the source.
D. Add a layer to the Lambda function. Select the S3 bucket as the source.

Highly Voted comment found!
The correct answer is (C).

Adding a trigger to your Lambda function is the solution that will meet these requirements. A trigger is an event that can invoke a Lambda function. In the case of this issue, the trigger must be an Amazon S3 event that fires when a new file is uploaded to the bucket.

Exam AWS Certified Developer - Associate DVA-C02 topic 1 question 212 discussion - Oct. 28, 2023, 3:55 a.m.
A company uses Amazon DynamoDB as a data store for its order management system. The company frontend application stores orders in a DynamoDB table. The DynamoDB table is configured to send change events to a DynamoDB stream. The company uses an AWS Lambda function to log and process the incoming orders based on data from the DynamoDB stream.
An operational review reveals that the order quantity of incoming orders is sometimes set to 0. A developer needs to create a dashboard that will show how many unique customers this problem affects each day.
What should the developer do to implement the dashboard?
A. Grant the Lambda function’s execution role permissions to upload logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. Implement a CloudWatch Logs Insights query that selects the number of unique customers for orders with order quantity equal to 0 and groups the results in 1-day periods. Add the CloudWatch Logs Insights query to a CloudWatch dashboard.
B. Use Amazon Athena to query AWS CloudTrail API logs for API calls. Implement an Athena query that selects the number of unique customers for orders with order quantity equal to 0 and groups the results in 1-day periods. Add the Athena query to an Amazon CloudWatch dashboard.
C. Configure the Lambda function to send events to Amazon EventBridge. Create an EventBridge rule that groups the number of unique customers for orders with order quantity equal to 0 in 1-day periods. Add a CloudWatch dashboard as the target of the rule.
D. Turn on custom Amazon CloudWatch metrics for the DynamoDB stream of the DynamoDB table. Create a CloudWatch alarm that groups the number of unique customers for orders with order quantity equal to 0 in 1-day periods. Add the CloudWatch alarm to a CloudWatch dashboard.

A. Grant the Lambda function’s execution role permissions to upload logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. Implement a CloudWatch Logs Insights query that selects the number of unique customers for orders with order quantity equal to 0 and groups the results in 1-day periods. Add the CloudWatch Logs Insights query to a CloudWatch dashboard.

Here's why this option is the best choice:

CloudWatch Logs Insights is designed for querying and analyzing log data, making it well-suited for this task.

By configuring the Lambda function's execution role to upload logs to CloudWatch Logs, you ensure that the log data is available for analysis.

You can use a CloudWatch Logs Insights query to identify unique customers for orders with a quantity of 0 and group the results by day, providing the desired daily count of affected customers.

The results of the query can be added to a CloudWatch dashboard, making it easily accessible for monitoring.

A developer needs to troubleshoot an AWS Lambda function in a development environment. The Lambda function is configured in VPC mode and needs to connect to an existing Amazon RDS for SQL Server DB instance. The DB instance is deployed in a private subnet and accepts connections by using port 1433.
When the developer tests the function, the function reports an error when it tries to connect to the database.
Which combination of steps should the developer take to diagnose this issue? (Choose two.)
A. Check that the function’s security group has outbound access on port 1433 to the DB instance’s security group. Check that the DB instance’s security group has inbound access on port 1433 from the function’s security group.
B. Check that the function’s security group has inbound access on port 1433 from the DB instance’s security group. Check that the DB instance’s security group has outbound access on port 1433 to the function’s security group.
C. Check that the VPC is set up for a NAT gateway. Check that the DB instance has the public access option turned on.
D. Check that the function’s execution role permissions include rds:DescribeDBInstances, rds:ModifyDBInstance. and rds:DescribeDBSecurityGroups for the DB instance.
E. Check that the function’s execution role permissions include ec2:CreateNetworkInterface, ec2:DescribeNetworkInterfaces, and ec2:DeleteNetworkInterface.

A developer is designing a serverless application that customers use to select seats for a concert venue. Customers send the ticket requests to an Amazon API Gateway API with an AWS Lambda function that acknowledges the order and generates an order ID. The application includes two additional Lambda functions: one for inventory management and one for payment processing. These two Lambda functions run in parallel and write the order to an Amazon Dynamo DB table.
The application must provide seats to customers according to the following requirements. If a seat is accidently sold more than once, the first order that the application received must get the seat. In these cases, the application must process the payment for only the first order. However, if the first order is rejected during payment processing, the second order must get the seat. In these cases, the application must process the payment for the second order.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A. Send the order ID to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) FIFO topic that fans out to one Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) FIFO queue for inventory management and another SQS FIFO queue for payment processing.
B. Change the Lambda function that generates the order ID to initiate the Lambda function for inventory management. Then initiate the Lambda function for payment processing.
C. Send the order ID to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic. Subscribe the Lambda functions for inventory management and payment processing to the topic.
D. Deliver the order ID to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Configure the Lambda functions for inventory management and payment processing to poll the queue.

Highly Voted comment found!
A. The only viable solution
******************************
Highly Voted comment found!
Here's why this solution is most appropriate:

SNS FIFO Topic: A First-In-First-Out (FIFO) SNS topic ensures that messages are delivered in the exact order they are sent. This is critical for maintaining the order of ticket requests.

SQS FIFO Queues: By having two separate FIFO queues for inventory management and payment processing, the application can process these aspects in parallel while still maintaining the order integrity. The FIFO nature of the queues ensures that if a seat is sold more than once, the first order received is processed first.

Order Processing Logic: With this setup, if the first order is rejected during payment processing, the second order can be processed next. The sequential processing inherent in FIFO queues ensures that this logic can be correctly implemented.

This approach involves creating a single API Gateway and a single Lambda function. Within the API Gateway, you can create multiple stages, each corresponding to a different environment (development, test, production). Similarly, for the Lambda function, you can create multiple aliases, each pointing to a different version of the Lambda function that corresponds to each environment. This setup allows for clear separation of environments within the same set of resources. It simplifies deployment and management by reducing the number of resources and also provides an easy way to promote changes from one environment to another.

B. A Lambda function can be registered with an ALB using AWS Management Console only.
C. The permissions to invoke the Lambda function are missing.
D. Cross-zone is not enabled on the ALB.

Highly Voted comment found!
To allow an ALB to invoke a Lambda function, you need to grant the ALB permission to invoke the Lambda. This is typically done by adding a resource-based policy to the Lambda function, granting invoke permission to the ALB. If this permission is not set, the ALB will not be able to trigger the Lambda function in response to incoming requests.

A developer is troubleshooting an application in an integration environment. In the application, an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue consumes messages and then an AWS Lambda function processes the messages. The Lambda function transforms the messages and makes an API call to a third-party service.
There has been an increase in application usage. The third-party API frequently returns an HTTP 429 Too Many Requests error message. The error message prevents a significant number of messages from being processed successfully.
How can the developer resolve this issue?
A. Increase the SQS event source’s batch size setting.
B. Configure provisioned concurrency for the Lambda function based on the third-party API’s documented rate limits.
C. Increase the retry attempts and maximum event age in the Lambda function’s asynchronous configuration.

A company has a three-tier application that is deployed in Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS). The application is using an Amazon RDS for MySQL DB instance. The application performs more database reads than writes.
During times of peak usage, the application’s performance degrades. When this performance degradation occurs, the DB instance’s ReadLatency metric in Amazon CloudWatch increases suddenly.
How should a developer modify the application to improve performance?
A. Use Amazon ElastiCache to cache query results.
B. Scale the ECS cluster to contain more ECS instances.
C. Add read capacity units (RCUs) to the DB instance.
D. Modify the ECS task definition to increase the task memory.

Highly Voted comment found!
Amazon ElastiCache can significantly enhance the read performance of the application by caching frequently accessed data. This reduces the load on the RDS database by serving repeated read requests from the cache rather than querying the database each time. This is particularly effective for applications with a high read-to-write ratio and can lead to a substantial reduction in the ReadLatency metric of the database.

A developer is writing an application to encrypt files outside of AWS before uploading the files to an Amazon S3 bucket. The encryption must be symmetric and must be performed inside the application.
How can the developer implement the encryption in the application to meet these requirements?
A. Create a data key in AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS). Use the AWS Encryption SDK to encrypt the files.
B. Create a Hash-Based Message Authentication Code (HMAC) key in AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS). Use the AWS Encryption SDK to encrypt the files.
C. Create a data key pair in AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS). Use the AWS CLI to encrypt the files.
D. Create a data key in AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS). Use the AWS CLI to encrypt the files.

Highly Voted comment found!
This option aligns with the requirements. AWS KMS allows the creation of symmetric data keys which can be used for encryption outside of AWS. The AWS Encryption SDK is designed to simplify encryption and decryption operations, making it a suitable choice for implementing encryption within the application. The developer can use the data key obtained from AWS KMS for the encryption process.

This approach follows AWS best practices. An IAM role can be created with the necessary permissions to access the S3 bucket. Then, this role can be associated with the EC2 instance. Applications running on the instance can then use the role's permissions to access S3 securely, without needing to manage access keys. This method leverages AWS's built-in security mechanisms and avoids the risks associated with managing static credentials.

A developer created a web API that receives requests by using an internet-facing Application Load Balancer (ALB) with an HTTPS listener. The developer configures an Amazon Cognito user pool and wants to ensure that every request to the API is authenticated through Amazon Cognito.
What should the developer do to meet this requirement?
A. Add a listener rule to the listener to return a fixed response if the Authorization header is missing. Set the fixed response to 401 Unauthorized.
B. Create an authentication action for the listener rules of the ALSet the rule action type to authenticate-cognito. Set the OnUnauthenticatedRequest field to “deny.”
C. Create an Amazon API Gateway API. Configure all API methods to be forwarded to the ALB endpoint. Create an authorizer of the COGNITO_USER_POOLS type. Configure every API method to use that authorizer.
D. Create a new target group that includes an AWS Lambda function target that validates the Authorization header by using Amazon Cognito. Associate the target group with the listener.

Highly Voted comment found!
This approach uses the built-in capabilities of the ALB to authenticate requests with Amazon Cognito. By configuring a rule action to authenticate with a Cognito user pool, the ALB can handle authentication before the request is forwarded to the target group. The OnUnauthenticatedRequest setting of "deny" ensures that unauthenticated requests are not allowed access, which aligns with the requirement to authenticate every request.

A company recently deployed an AWS Lambda function. A developer notices an increase in the function throttle metrics in Amazon CloudWatch.
What are the MOST operationally efficient solutions to reduce the function throttling? (Choose two.)
A. Migrate the function to Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS).
B. Increase the maximum age of events in Lambda.
C. Increase the function’s reserved concurrency.
D. Add the lambda:GetFunctionConcurrency action to the execution role.
E. Request a service quota change for increased concurrency.

Highly Voted comment found!
C. Increase the function’s reserved concurrency.
Reserved concurrency is a feature in AWS Lambda that allows you to allocate a specific amount of concurrency to a particular function. This ensures that the function has a dedicated amount of concurrency and is not affected by throttling due to high usage of other functions in your account. Increasing the reserved concurrency can help mitigate throttling issues, especially if the throttling is due to reaching account-level concurrency limits.

E. Request a service quota change for increased concurrency.
AWS Lambda has default service quotas (formerly known as limits) for the maximum number of concurrent executions across all functions in your account. If your Lambda function is experiencing throttling due to reaching these account-level concurrency limits, requesting an increase in the service quota for Lambda concurrency can provide a solution.

B. Immutable: In an immutable deployment, AWS Elastic Beanstalk deploys the application version to a fresh group of instances in a new Auto Scaling group. Once the new instances pass health checks, they are moved to the existing Auto Scaling group, and the old instances are terminated. This approach ensures that new instances are used for the deployment, minimizing the impact on the existing environment.

D. Blue/Green: Blue/green deployment involves deploying the new version of the application to a separate environment (the "green" environment). Once the new environment is ready and tested, the traffic is switched from the old environment (the "blue" environment) to the new one. This type of deployment is effective for ensuring that the new version is deployed on new instances and provides a straightforward way to rollback if needed.

C. Use the AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) CLI to run and locally test the Lambda functions.
D. Use AWS Step Functions Local with mocked service integrations.

Highly Voted comment found!
AWS Step Functions Local allows developers to test Step Functions workflows on their local machines, without the need to deploy them to AWS. By using Step Functions Local, developers can simulate Step Functions and mock the integration with AWS services such as Amazon SQS and Amazon S3. This approach is ideal for testing the flow of the ML pipeline, including the interaction of Lambda functions, without actually triggering external AWS services.

A developer is building a serverless application that runs on AWS. The developer wants to create an accelerated development workflow that deploys incremental changes to AWS for testing. The developer wants to deploy the incremental changes but does not want to fully deploy the entire application to AWS for every code commit.
What should the developer do to meet these requirements?
A. Use the AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) to build the application. Use the sam sync command to deploy the incremental changes.
B. Use the AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) to build the application. Use the sam init command to deploy the incremental changes.
C. Use the AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) to build the application. Use the cdk synth command to deploy the incremental changes.
D. Use the AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) to build the application. Use the cdk bootstrap command to deploy the incremental changes.

Highly Voted comment found!
Here the answer is A - sam sync. 
According to my research: 
- cdk synth: only constructs your CloudFormation template. It does not deploy (create actual resources) it to AWS. You can take the template constructed, deploy it manually in CFN console, edit or inspect.
- sam init: used to initialize a new serverless application
- cdk bootstrap: the main purpose of cdk bootstrap is to provision a set of resources required to support the deployment of AWS CDK applications

Highly Voted comment found!
Using the KMS Encrypt API to encrypt large amounts of data, such as a PDF file that could be more than 1 MB, is not efficient and can be costly. AWS KMS is designed for encrypting small amounts of data, such as encryption keys or short strings. For larger data, it's recommended to use a client-side encryption library with a data key generated by KMS.

Option B is not ideal because writing all data to an S3 bucket would introduce network latency and might impact performance.
By default, Amazon EBS volumes can only be attached to one EC2 instance at a time, and they cannot be mounted to multiple instances simultaneously. However, AWS does offer a feature called Amazon EBS Multi-Attach, which allows you to attach a Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1 or io2) EBS volume to up to 16 Nitro-based EC2 instances within the same Availability Zone. This feature is designed for applications that require concurrent access to the same data from multiple instances, such as clustered databases or parallel file systems.

D. Modify the application to use the S3 GetObject API call and to return the object handle to the user.
E. Modify the application to delegate requests to the S3 bucket.

Highly Voted comment found!
A. Creating an EC2 instance profile and role with an appropriate policy and associating the role with the EC2 instances follows the principle of least privilege. The EC2 instances will have temporary security credentials provided by the role, and the permissions granted to the role can be tightly controlled using IAM policies. This approach eliminates the need to manage and store long-term access keys on the EC2 instances, which can be a security risk.

C. Using the S3 GeneratePresignedUrl API call allows the application to generate time-limited URLs that provide temporary access to objects in the S3 bucket. These pre-signed URLs can be generated for authenticated users, ensuring that only authorized users can access the objects. This approach ensures that the objects in the S3 bucket remain private and are not publicly accessible.

If we run event at regular intervals (what does it mean?) should we run it every hour and then we would have bunch of untagged objects that haven't been audited and we would add a tag to them which doesn't make sense.

- In option B they explicitly mention that the Wait period will be 24 hours thus insuring that the audit of those objects has been completed. Only then we run the Lambda function.

C. Create an AWS Lambda function to load all untagged S3 objects. Retrieve the results for each item from the REST API and tag each S3 object accordingly. Create and configure an Amazon EventBridge rule to run at regular intervals. Set the Lambda function as a target for the EventBridge rule.

This solution leverages AWS Lambda for processing and tagging S3 objects based on the audit results available through the REST API. By using Amazon EventBridge to trigger the Lambda function at regular intervals, the developer ensures that the process runs automatically without manual intervention, efficiently handling the tagging of S3 objects once the audit results are available. This approach minimizes operational effort and does not require the continuous monitoring of S3 object creation or the management of complex workflows.

Using MFA with AssumeRole
(Optional) You can include multi-factor authentication (MFA) information when you call AssumeRole. This is useful for cross-account scenarios to ensure that the user that assumes the role has been authenticated with an AWS MFA device. In that scenario, the trust policy of the role being assumed includes a condition that tests for MFA authentication. If the caller does not include valid MFA information, the request to assume the role is denied.

B. Configure managed rotation with the alternating users rotation strategy.
C. Configure automatic rotation with the single user rotation strategy.

Managed rotation vs. automatic rotation:
Managed rotation requires manual intervention to specify when a secret should be rotated. This doesn't meet the requirement of automated password rotation on a regular basis.
Automatic rotation automatically rotates secrets based on a defined schedule, meeting the requirement for regular password changes.
Single user vs. alternating users:
Single user rotation means there is only one set of credentials. Rotating this would cause downtime as the application needs to update its connection information.
Alternating users rotation uses two sets of credentials. Only one is active at a time. When it's time to rotate, the inactive set is rotated, and then the application switches to using that set, avoiding downtime

D. Use AWS Elastic Beanstalk to deploy the application to the environments.

Highly Voted comment found!
This approach allows for easy management of multiple environments within the same AWS infrastructure. API Gateway stage variables can be used to manage configurations that differ between environments, such as endpoint URLs or configuration settings. Similarly, Lambda aliases can point to different versions of Lambda functions, making it possible to deploy different versions of the codebase to different environments (e.g., development, test, production) without duplicating the code. This solution is both efficient and scalable, enabling quick updates and minimal overhead in managing environment-specific configurations.

A developer needs to deploy an application in three AWS Regions by using AWS CloudFormation. Each Region will use an AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment with an Application Load Balancer (ALB). The developer wants to use AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to deploy SSL certificates to each ALB.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A. Create a certificate in ACM in any one of the Regions. Import the certificate into the ALB that is in each Region.
B. Create a global certificate in ACM. Update the CloudFormation template to deploy the global certificate to each ALB.
C. Create a certificate in ACM in each Region. Import the certificate into the ALB for each Region.
D. Create a certificate in ACM in the us-east-1 Region. Update the CloudFormation template to deploy the certificate to each ALB.

Highly Voted comment found!
Regional Certificates: ACM certificates are regional resources. They cannot be shared across different Regions. Creating a certificate in each Region ensures proper certificate management and association with the ALBs.
CloudFormation Integration: CloudFormation allows you to define resources and their configurations for individual Regions. Creating certificates within the template for each Region aligns well with this approach.

A developer is building an application that invokes AWS Lambda functions asynchronously to process events. The developer notices that a Lambda function fails to process some events at random times. The developer needs to investigate the failed events and capture the events that the Lambda function fails to process.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A. Add an Amazon EventBridge rule for the Lambda function. Configure the EventBridge rule to react to failed events and to store the events in an Amazon DynamoDB table.
B. Configure the Lambda function with a dead-letter queue based in Amazon Kinesis. Update the Lambda function's execution role with the required permissions.
C. Configure the Lambda function with an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) dead-letter queue. Update the Lambda function's execution role with the required permissions.
D. Configure the Lambda function with an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) FIFO dead-letter queue. Update the Lambda function's execution role with the required permissions.

Highly Voted comment found!
The standard SQS dead-letter queue should capture the failed events and let the developer debug them, so C is the right solution. 
B - There's no such thing as a DLQ in Kinesis. 
D - SQS FIFO DLQ would be too much overkill for this task because you don't need ordering or deduplication. 
A - This would involve additional costs and too much complexity to use a DynamoDB table for this.

A company has built a serverless application for its ecommerce website. The application includes a REST API in Amazon API Gateway that invokes an AWS Lambda function. The Lambda function processes data and stores the data in Amazon DynamoDB table. The Lambda function calls a third-party stock application API to process the order. After the ordered is processed, the Lambda function returns an HTTP 200 status code with no body to the client.
During peak usage when the API calls exceeds a certain threshold, the third-party stock application sometimes fails to process the data and responds with error messages. The company needs a solution that will not overwhelm the third-party stock application.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A. Configure the REST API in API Gateway to write the requests directly into DynamoDB. Configure a DynamoDB intrinsic function to perform the transformation. Set up a DynamoDB stream to call the third-party stock application API with each new row. Delete the Lambda function.
B. Configure the REST API in API Gateway to write the requests directly into an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Configure the Lambda function with a reserved concurrency equal to the third-party stock application's threshold. Set Lambda function to process the messages from the SQS queue.
C. Configure the REST API in API Gateway to write the requests directly into an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic. Configure the Lambda function with a provisioned concurrency equal to the third-party stock application's threshold. Set the Lambda function to process the messages from the SNS topic.

A company has a mobile app. The app includes an Amazon API Gateway REST API that invokes AWS Lambda functions. The Lambda functions process data from the app.
The company needs to test updated Lambda functions that have new features. The company must conduct these tests with a subset of users before deployment. The tests must not affect other users of the app.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST amount of operational effort?
A. Create a new version of each Lambda function with a weighted alias. Configure a weight value for each version of the Lambda function. Update the new weighted alias Amazon Resource Name (ARN) in the REST API.
B. Create a new REST API in API Gateway. Set up a Lambda proxy integration to connect to multiple Lambda functions. Enable canary settings on the deployment stage. Specify a smaller percentage of API traffic to go to the new version of the Lambda function.
C. Create a new version of each Lambda function. Integrate a predefined canary deployment in AWS CodeDeploy to slowly shift the traffic to the new versions automatically.
D. Create a new REST API in API Gateway. Set up a Lambda non-proxy integration to connect to multiple Lambda functions. Specify the necessary parameters and properties in API Gateway. Enable canary settings on the deployment stage. Specify a smaller percentage of API traffic to go to the new version of the Lambda function.

Highly Voted comment found!
The wording is screaming out weighted alias. During a canary deployment, we are moving code from testing to prod. We can define a subset of users i.e. 10% for a set period of time. After this the other users will be impacted as the percentage will increment or the deployment will push new code to 100% of users.

With a weighted alias we can define a subset of users and use this as our guinea pigs to test new code. As this isn't a canary deployment we have no risk of more users becoming impacted. Operational overhead is minimal as we only need to point to a new alias.

With weighted alias we can deploy for testing purposes. From my understanding lambda proxy is grouping lambda functions. the traffic splitting would need to be set at the lambda level as this is testing prior to deployment.

Didn't like the wording.

A - provisioned concurrency keeps 2 functions on warm standby for critical work. this is a minimum. question is asking about a maximum of 2.
B - Batch of 2 is fine. latency could see this fall flat on it's face though. lambda invocations between function and SQS are limited to 2, not strictly between lambda and vendor API.
C - event filtering is completely irrelevant here.
D - Maximum is what the question is asking for. this will limit the amount of requests made to the vendor API. I would much prefer to set the reserved concurrency at the lambda level but this can be overridden at the SQS event source mapping level so I guess this is the best answer.

A company recently deployed a new serverless user portal. Users have reported that part of the portal is slow. The initial analysis found a single Amazon API Gateway endpoint that is responsible for the performance issues. The endpoint integrates with an AWS Lambda function. However, the Lambda function interacts with other APIs and AWS services.
How can a developer find the source of the increased response time by using operational best practices?
A. Update the Lambda function by adding logging statements with high-precision timestamps before and after each external request. Deploy the updated Lambda function. After accumulating enough usage data, examine the Amazon CloudWatch logs for the Lambda function to determine the likely sources for the increased response time.
B. Instrument the Lambda function with the AWS X-Ray SDK. Add HTTP and HTTPS interceptors and SDK client handlers. Deploy the updated Lambda function. Turn on X-Ray tracing. After accumulating enough usage data, use the X-Ray service map to examine the average response times to determine the likely sources.
C. Review the Lambda function's Amazon CloudWatch metrics by using the metrics explorer. Apply anomaly detection to the Duration metric and the Throttles metric. Review the anomalies to determine the likely sources.
D. Use Amazon CloudWatch Synthetics to create a new canary. Turn on AWS X-Ray tracing on the canary. Configure the canary to scan the user portal. After accumulating enough usage data, use the CloudWatch Synthetics canary dashboard to view the metrics from the canary.

A company's application has an AWS Lambda function that processes messages from IoT devices. The company wants to monitor the Lambda function to ensure that the Lambda function is meeting its required service level agreement (SLA).
A developer must implement a solution to determine the application's throughput in near real time. The throughput must be based on the number of messages that the Lambda function receives and processes in a given time period. The Lambda function performs initialization and post-processing steps that must not factor into the throughput measurement.
What should the developer do to meet these requirements?
A. Use the Lambda function's ConcurrentExecutions metric in Amazon CloudWatch to measure the throughput.
B. Modify the application to log the calculated throughput to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. Use Amazon EventBridge to invoke a separate Lambda function to process the logs on a schedule.
C. Modify the application to publish custom Amazon CloudWatch metrics when the Lambda function receives and processes each message. Use the metrics to calculate the throughput.
D. Use the Lambda function's Invocations metric and Duration metric to calculate the throughput in Amazon CloudWatch.

Highly Voted comment found!
Use the metrics to calculate the throughput. This is because custom metrics can provide a more accurate measure of throughput, as they can be configured to only increment when a message is received and processed by the Lambda function. This would exclude the time spent on initialization and post-processing, which are not part of the throughput measurement.

As it is the DB hostname and not sensitive credentials I think ssm dynamic is the correct answer. 
Option D - is for secure string whereas this parameter is currently stored in plain text.
For option C, I opted against this because for an import value, I believe there needs to be an export value from another template. The question didn't state that anything else was created via CF template.
Option B -  I understand to be used to reference another resource block that is in the same YAML template.

Exam AWS Certified Developer - Associate DVA-C02 topic 1 question 360 discussion - July 5, 2024, 4:46 p.m.
A developer is building an ecommerce application. When there is a sale event, the application needs to concurrently call three third-party systems to record the sale. The developer wrote three AWS Lambda functions. There is one Lambda function for each third-party system, which contains complex integration logic.
These Lambda functions are all independent. The developer needs to design the application so each Lambda function will run regardless of others' success or failure.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A. Publish the sale event from the application to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Configure the three Lambda functions to poll the queue.
B. Publish the sale event from the application to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic. Subscribe the three Lambda functions to be triggered by the SNS topic.
C. Publish the sale event from the application to an Application Load Balancer (ALB). Add the three Lambda functions as ALB targets.
D. Publish the sale event from the application to an AWS Step Functions state machine. Move the logic from the three Lambda functions into the Step Functions state machine.

A developer manages an application that writes customer orders to an Amazon DynamoDB table. The orders use customer_id as the partition key, order_id as the sort key, and order_date as an attribute. A new access pattern requires accessing data by order_date and order_id. The developer needs to implement a new AWS Lambda function to support the new access pattern.
How should the developer support the new access pattern in the MOST operationally efficient way?
A. Add a new local secondary index (LSI) to the DynamoDB table that specifies order_date as the partition key and order_id as the sort key. Write the new Lambda function to query the new LSI index.
B. Write the new Lambda function to scan the DynamoDB table. In the Lambda function, write a method to retrieve and combine results by order_date and order_id.
C. Add a new global secondary index (GSI) to the DynamoDB table that specifies order_date as the partition key and order_id as the sort key. Write the new Lambda function to query the new GSI index.
D. Enable DynamoDB Streams on the table. Choose the new and old images information to write to the DynamoDB stream. Write the new Lambda function to query the DynamoDB stream

Highly Voted comment found!
C
Global Secondary Index (GSI) allows you to specify a completely different partition key and potentially a different sort key from those on the main table. This flexibility is crucial when you need to support additional access patterns that aren't directly supported by the existing table's key structure. In this scenario, specifying order_date as the new partition key and order_id as the sort key in a GSI will enable efficient querying based on these attributes.

Lambda Function Querying GSI: Once the GSI is set up, the Lambda function can perform efficient query operations directly on this index to fetch records based on order_date and order_id, which is much more efficient than scanning the entire table.

D 
Explicit deny policies in IAM take precedence over any allow policies. If the IAM role attached to the EC2 instance explicitly denies access to S3, this deny will apply regardless of any other credentials or policies that might grant access.

Even though the EC2 instance's credentials file specifies keys with full administrative access, the explicit deny in the IAM role will override these permissions for S3 actions.

A developer has an application that uses an Amazon DynamoDB table with a configured local secondary index (LSI). During application testing, the DynamoDB table metrics report a ProvisionedThroughputExceededException error message. The number of requests made by the test suite did not exceed the table's provisioned capacity limits.
What is the cause of this issue?
A. The data in the table's partition key column is not evenly distributed.
B. The LSI's capacity is different from the table's capacity.
C. The application is not implementing exponential backoff retry logic while interacting with the DynamoDB API.
D. The application has the IAM permission to query the DynamoDB table but not to query the LSI.

Highly Voted comment found!
The most likely cause of the ProvisionedThroughputExceededException error message is:

A. The data in the table's partition key column is not evenly distributed.
Explanation

In DynamoDB, the provisioned throughput capacity is distributed across all the partitions in the table. If the data in the partition key column is not evenly distributed, some partitions may receive more traffic than others. This can lead to hot partitions, which consume more read/write capacity units than others, resulting in ProvisionedThroughputExceededException errors even if the overall request rate is within the table's provisioned throughput limits.

A company uses AWS X-Ray to monitor a serverless application. The components of the application have different request rates. The user interactions and transactions are important to trace, but they are low in volume. The background processes such as application health checks, polling, and connection maintenance generate high volumes of read-only requests.
Currently, the default X-Ray sampling rules are universal for all requests. Only the first request per second and some additional requests are recorded. This setup is not helping the company review the requests based on service or request type.
A developer must configure rules to trace requests based on service or request properties. The developer must trace the user interactions and transactions without wasting effort recording minor background tasks.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A. Disable sampling for high-volume read-only requests. Sample at a lower rate for all requests that handle user interactions or transactions.
B. Disable sampling and trace all requests for requests that handle user interactions or transactions. Sample high-volume read-only requests at a higher rate.
C. Disable sampling and trace all requests for requests that handle user interactions or transactions. Sample high-volume read-only requests at a lower rate.

Exam AWS Certified Developer - Associate DVA-C02 topic 1 question 450 discussion - Nov. 5, 2024, 12:08 p.m.
A developer has an application that uses AWS Lambda functions and AWS CloudFormation templates. Usage of the application has increased. As a result, the Lambda functions are encountering rate limit errors when they retrieve data.
The Lambda functions retrieve an advanced parameter from AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store on every call. The parameter changes only during new deployments. Because the application’s usage is unpredictable, the developer needs a way to avoid the rate limiting.
Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?
A. Configure the Lambda functions to use reserved concurrency that is equal to the last month’s average number of concurrent invocations.
B. Add a retry mechanism with exponential backoff to the call to Parameter Store.
C. Request a service quota increase for Parameter Store GetParameter API operations to match the expected usage of the Lambda functions.
D. Add an SSM dynamic reference as an environment variable to the Lambda functions resource in the CloudFormation templates.

Highly Voted comment found!
D is correct The application experiences rate limiting because Lambda calls the Parameter Store every time the function is run. This means that as the number of Lambda calls increases, each call also triggers a request from the Parameter Store, which increases the number of requests and leads to exceeding the limit.

Using an SSM dynamic reference as an environmental variable in CloudFormation will allow Lambda to load the value only once on startup, and there will be no need to request the value of the variable from the Parameter Store on each call. This way, the value is obtained directly from the pre-loaded environmental variable instead of sending additional requests.

A developer is building an application that stores sensitive user data. The application includes an Amazon CloudFront distribution and multiple AWS Lambda functions that handle user requests.
The user requests contain over 20 data fields. Each application transaction contains sensitive data that must be encrypted. Only specific parts of the application need to have the ability to decrypt the data.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A. Associate the CloudFront distribution with a Lambda@Edge function. Configure the function to perform field-level asymmetric encryption by using a user-defined RSA public key that is stored in AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS).
B. Integrate AWS WAF with CloudFront to protect the sensitive data. Use a Lambda function and self-managed keys to perform the encryption and decryption processes.
C. Configure the CloudFront distribution to use WebSockets by forwarding all viewer request headers to the origin. Create an asymmetric AWS KMS key. Configure the CloudFront distribution to use field-level encryption. Use the AWS KMS key.
D. Configure the cache behavior in the CloudFront distribution to require HTTPS for communication between viewers and CloudFront. Configure GoudFront to require users to access the files by using either signed URLs or signed cookies.
