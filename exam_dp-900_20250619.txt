Hi everyone! I just passed exam, my score is more then 900. 
1. Exam 80-90% consisted from questions from this site. 
2. Answers on this site for this questions are not always correct, and comments with answers are not always correct. 
3. If you are reading in comments "I passed exam and this question was on exam, the answers is __ (gives you some answer)"  - dont trust it blindly! They just tells their opinion about the answer. Because when you recieve you certification, your score, you do not recieve informations on what questions exactly you answered right or wrong! You just know your score and your score on every section. You dont know the answer and you no longer have access to question that you answered. 
4) Everyone good luck!  You can do it.

Star Schema in data warehouse, in which the center of the star can have one fact table and a number of associated dimension tables. It is known as star schema as its structure resembles a star.

Dimension tables describe business entities—the things you model. Entities can include products, people, places, and concepts including time itself. 
Fact tables store observations or events, and can be sales orders, stock balances, exchange rates, temperatures, etc. A fact table contains dimension key columns that relate to dimension tables, and numeric measure columns.

The chosen option is correct given the requirements in the question.
******************************
Highly Voted comment found!
Careful with this one. If we are talking about "outside replication", the options will be GRS and RA-GRS (particular case that gives active-active between regions with reading accessible in the second one). However, GRS does NOT allow to read in the secondary region in an active-active way. It only happens when the first region fails. Bear this in mind. The option is correct given the requirements in the question.

according to the link in description: The Answer is: simple lookups.

Key/value stores are highly optimized for applications performing simple lookups, but are less suitable if you need to query data across different key/value stores. Key/value stores are also not optimized for querying by value.

the reference:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/guide/technology-choices/data-store-overview#keyvalue-stores
******************************
Highly Voted comment found!
The answer given is correct. From the trainer handbook: A key-value store is the simplest (and often quickest) type of NoSQL database for inserting and querying data. Each data item in a key-value store has two elements, a key and a value. The key uniquely identifies the item, and the value holds the data for the item. The value is opaque to the database management system. Items are stored in key order.

Normalizing decreases throughput for reading (need to make joins), but increases for writing (Less to write, since there are no duplicates)
******************************
Highly Voted comment found!
NO
NO
YES

Answers are correct

Normalizing a Database increases the throughput for reading but reduces for writing.

A normalized database is advantageous when operations are write-intensive or ACID compliance is required. Some advantages include:

Updates run quickly due to no data being duplicated in multiple locations.
Inserts run quickly since there is only a single insertion point for a piece of data, and no duplication is required.
Tables are typically smaller than the tables found in non-normalized databases. This usually allows the tables to fit into the buffer, thus offering faster performance.
Data integrity and consistency are an absolute must if the database must be ACID compliant. A normalized database helps immensely with such an undertaking.

A.C.I.D. properties: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability
Atomicity - each statement in a transaction (to read, write, update or delete data) is treated as a single unit. Either the entire statement is executed, or none of it is executed. This property prevents data loss and corruption from occurring if, for example, if your streaming data source fails mid-stream.

SSDT for database projects is normally what people talk about when they say "why should I use ssdt over ssms", what I normally say is that ssms is an administration tool, and ssdt is the developer tool.

You have a transactional application that stores data in an Azure SQL managed instance.
When should you implement a read-only database replica?
A. You need to generate reports without affecting the transactional workload.
B. You need to audit the transactional application.
C. You need to implement high availability in the event of a regional outage.
D. You need to improve the recovery point objective (RPO).

Highly Voted comment found!
Why C? It is not High Availability if you cannot write to the database. If your primary database goes down, HA means that users would continue to work as normal, but they cannot commit changes in this case (Read-Only). Answer should be only: A.
******************************
Highly Voted comment found!
I would go for A, read only replica is created to offload part of transactions (backup, reporting...) in order to free up resources on DB.

Not a trick question, just how much you understand database.

Select * From Countries where CountryName = "USA"
This is a full table scan because CountryName is not a key, the engine need to compare every row.

Select * From Countries where CountryID = 33
This is not a full table scan, it become a index scan because CountryID is a key so the engine know it can skip to that ID

Select * From Countries
This is a full table scan but with no criteria, so it extract everything out

A. Azure Disk Storage
B. Azure Data Lake Storage
C. Azure Blob storage
D. Azure Queue storage

Highly Voted comment found!
The given answer is correct
******************************
Highly Voted comment found!
Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 implements an access control model that supports both Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) and POSIX-like access control lists (ACLs). This article summarizes the basics of the access control model for Data Lake Storage Gen2.

ACLs are applied on the file and folder level. The key thing to remember is that you are always going to need RBAC Control Plane permissions in combination with ACLs. Best practice is to assign your security principals RBAC Reader role on the Storage Account/Container level and continue with more restrictive ACLs on the file and folder level.

There are two types of ACLs:

Access ACLs: They control access to an object. An object can be a file or a folder.

Default ACLs: These are ACLs assigned on the folder level only which get inherited as Access ACLs by the child file or folder.

Security at the folder level: With hierarchical namespace enabled, you can set different security permissions (e.g. read, write, delete) on different folders within the storage account, allowing you to better control access to your data.

Atomic directory manipulation: With hierarchical namespace enabled, you can perform atomic operations on directories, such as renaming or moving a directory and all its contents in one single operation. This ensures that the entire operation is completed or rolled back as a whole, avoiding partial changes to the data.

However, that data is available to be read only if the customer or Microsoft initiates a failover from the primary to secondary region. When you enable read access to the secondary region, your data is available to be read ****** at all times ******, including in a situation where the primary region becomes unavailable.

D is definitely correct. Batch data can be run weekly, monthly, or even yearly.

Don't get tricked with this one:
A) doesn't make any sense as there is no data processing in the background. Batch means to process a big volume of data in a particular time of the day (e.g. in the night with idle VMs)
B) You can once per day if you define it as such but in any case you are limited by "one day". So it's no.
C) Nonsense. Batch data is not a design for RT/streaming data OTA. You would use a different solution as data bricks. Reason that data bricks service exists.
D) Correct. You can define your condition. Once it's met, you can execute it.

D. stores raw data only

Highly Voted comment found!
when its not clear here what to consider as correct answer? paying for dump is not worth in this type of question.
******************************
Highly Voted comment found!
Personal preferrence goes to B. Key phrase is 'modern' data warehouse.

From Microsoft learn:
Large-scale data warehousing solutions combine conventional data warehousing used to support business intelligence (BI) with techniques used for so-called "big data" analytics. A conventional data warehousing solution typically involves copying data from transactional data stores into a relational database with a schema that's optimized for querying and building multidimensional models. Big Data processing solutions on the other hand, are used with large volumes of data in multiple formats, which is batch loaded or captured in real-time streams and stored in a data lake from which distributed processing engines like Apache Spark are used to process it.

Answer C is functional of conventional data warehouse.

A. atomicity
B. durability
C. isolation
D. consistency

Highly Voted comment found!
Atomicity is the right answer.  
An atomic transaction is an indivisible and irreducible series of database operations such that either all occurs, or nothing occurs. A guarantee of atomicity prevents updates to the database occurring only partially, which can cause greater problems than rejecting the whole series outright. As a consequence, the transaction cannot be observed to be in progress by another database client.

Dimensions:- In a star schema, the entities by which you aggregate or slice measures are called dimensions. Dimensions are the descriptive attributes or perspectives of the data that provide the context for the measures (also known as facts) in the model.

For example, in a sales data star schema, the dimensions could be time, product, store location, and customer. These dimensions provide context for the sales measures such as total sales, units sold, and revenue. By aggregating or slicing the measures by different dimensions, you can gain insights into the data from different perspectives.

Exam DP-900 topic 1 question 285 discussion - Nov. 23, 2023, 1:27 p.m.
In an analytical data model, which type of table contains entities that are used to aggregate numeric values, where each entity is represented by a row with a unique key value?
A. bridge
B. dimension
C. fact

Highly Voted comment found!
- Fact Table is the correct answer because it is designed to store and aggregate numeric values. The rows in the fact table represent individual transactions or events and are uniquely identified by a combination of foreign keys and sometimes a unique identifier (such as a transaction ID).
- These numeric values (facts) are the ones aggregated to provide insights, such as total sales, average order value, or total profit, making the fact table central to quantitative analysis in an analytical data model.

Agree, for fully denormalized DB looks correct.
But why in 214-question, for fully normalized DB we can find the same answer, marked as correct? :)
******************************

Denormalization involves consolidating data into a single table to reduce the need for joins and simplify querying. This results in improved read performance as all the necessary data for a single entity can be retrieved from a single table without requiring joins with other tables. Similarly, when writing data, it is written to a single table without the need to update multiple tables. This approach is commonly used in data warehousing and reporting scenarios where read performance is prioritized over storage efficiency and data modification speed.

Correct: An aggregated measure.

In an analytical model, any point where dimensions intersect represents an aggregated measure. These intersections represent specific data points within the multidimensional structure, and the aggregated measures provide quantitative values based on the selected dimensions and context. Each intersection corresponds to a unique combination of dimension values, and the aggregated measure represents the result of applying aggregation functions (such as sum, average, count, etc.) to the underlying data associated with that combination of dimension values.

The answer is correct. 
Explanation from ChatGPT
Attribute - Get separated into individual columns
In a database, an attribute typically refers to a column in a table, which is where individual data elements of an entity are stored.
Entities - Get separated into individual tables
Entities in a database are typically represented as tables. Each table represents a specific type of object or concept within the system.
Foreign Keys - Link two related entities
A foreign key is a field (or collection of fields) in one table that uniquely identifies a row of another table. It is used to establish and enforce a link between the data in two tables.

Primary keys are the unique identifier for each record in a table.
Schema refers to the organization or structure of a database, including its tables, views, relationships, and other elements.
