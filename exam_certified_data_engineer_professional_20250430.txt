Exam Certified Data Engineer Professional topic 1 question 8 discussion
An upstream source writes Parquet data as hourly batches to directories named with the current date. A nightly batch job runs the following code to ingest all data from the previous day as indicated by the date variable:
https://img.examtopics.com/certified-data-engineer-professional/image7.png
Assume that the fields customer_id and order_id serve as a composite key to uniquely identify each order.
If the upstream system is known to occasionally produce duplicate entries for a single order hours apart, which statement is correct?
A. Each write to the orders table will only contain unique records, and only those records without duplicates in the target table will be written.
B. Each write to the orders table will only contain unique records, but newly written records may have duplicates already present in the target table.
C. Each write to the orders table will only contain unique records; if existing records with the same key are present in the target table, these records will be overwritten.
D. Each write to the orders table will only contain unique records; if existing records with the same key are present in the target table, the operation will fail.
E. Each write to the orders table will run deduplication over the union of new and existing records, ensuring no duplicate records are present.

Highly Voted comment found!
B. Each write to the orders table will only contain unique records, but newly written records may have duplicates already present in the target table.

Explanation:

In the provided code, the .dropDuplicates(["customer_id","order_id"]) operation is performed on the data loaded from the Parquet files. This operation ensures that only unique records, based on the composite key of "customer_id" and "order_id," are retained in the DataFrame before writing to the "orders" table.

However, this operation does not consider duplicates that may already exist in the "orders" table. It only filters duplicates from the current batch of data. If there are duplicates in the "orders" table from previous batches, they will remain in the table.

So, newly written records will not have duplicates within the batch being written, but duplicates from previous batches may still exist in the target table.

A junior member of the data engineering team is exploring the language interoperability of Databricks notebooks. The intended outcome of the below code is to register a view of all sales that occurred in countries on the continent of Africa that appear in the geo_lookup table.
Before executing the code, running SHOW TABLES on the current database indicates the database contains only two tables: geo_lookup and sales.
https://img.examtopics.com/certified-data-engineer-professional/image8.png
Which statement correctly describes the outcome of executing these command cells in order in an interactive notebook?
A. Both commands will succeed. Executing show tables will show that countries_af and sales_af have been registered as views.
B. Cmd 1 will succeed. Cmd 2 will search all accessible databases for a table or view named countries_af: if this entity exists, Cmd 2 will succeed.
C. Cmd 1 will succeed and Cmd 2 will fail. countries_af will be a Python variable representing a PySpark DataFrame.
D. Both commands will fail. No new variables, tables, or views will be created.
E. Cmd 1 will succeed and Cmd 2 will fail. countries_af will be a Python variable containing a list of strings.

Highly Voted comment found!
Cmd 1 is a PySpark command that collects the list of countries from the 'geo_lookup' table where the continent is Africa ('AF'). This command will execute successfully, resulting in countries_af being a list of country names (strings) in Python's local memory.

Cmd 2 is an SQL command intended to create a view named 'sales_af' from the 'sales' table, filtered by the cities in the countries_af list. However, this will fail because the countries_af variable exists in the Python environment and is not recognized in the SQL context. SQL does not have access to Python variables directly; they are two separate execution contexts within a Databricks notebook. There is no table or view named countries_af that SQL can reference; it is merely a Python list variable.

The other options are incorrect because they either assume cross-contextual operation between Python and SQL within a Databricks notebook (which is not possible in the way described in the commands), or they do not correctly interpret the outcome of running the commands.

Which statement describes how the Delta engine identifies which files to load?
A. All records are cached to an operational database and then the filter is applied
B. The Parquet file footers are scanned for min and max statistics for the latitude column
C. All records are cached to attached storage and then the filter is applied
D. The Delta log is scanned for min and max statistics for the latitude column
E. The Hive metastore is scanned for min and max statistics for the latitude column

Answer D:

In the Transaction log, Delta Lake captures statistics for each data file of the table. These statistics indicate per file:
 - Total number of records
 - Minimum value in each column of the first 32 columns of the table
 - Maximum value in each column of the first 32 columns of the table
 - Null value counts for in each column of the first 32 columns of the table

When a query with a selective filter is executed against the table, the query optimizer uses these statistics to generate the query result. it leverages them to identify data files that may contain records matching the conditional filter.
For the SELECT query in the question, The transaction log is scanned for min and max statistics for the price column

Exam Certified Data Engineer Professional topic 1 question 11 discussion
The data engineering team has configured a job to process customer requests to be forgotten (have their data deleted). All user data that needs to be deleted is stored in Delta Lake tables using default table settings.
The team has decided to process all deletions from the previous week as a batch job at 1am each Sunday. The total duration of this job is less than one hour. Every Monday at 3am, a batch job executes a series of VACUUM commands on all Delta Lake tables throughout the organization.
The compliance officer has recently learned about Delta Lake's time travel functionality. They are concerned that this might allow continued access to deleted data.
Assuming all delete logic is correctly implemented, which statement correctly addresses this concern?
A. Because the VACUUM command permanently deletes all files containing deleted records, deleted records may be accessible with time travel for around 24 hours.
B. Because the default data retention threshold is 24 hours, data files containing deleted records will be retained until the VACUUM job is run the following day.
C. Because Delta Lake time travel provides full access to the entire history of a table, deleted records can always be recreated by users with full admin privileges.
D. Because Delta Lake's delete statements have ACID guarantees, deleted records will be permanently purged from all storage systems as soon as a delete job completes.
E. Because the default data retention threshold is 7 days, data files containing deleted records will be retained until the VACUUM job is run 8 days later.

Exam Certified Data Engineer Professional topic 1 question 13 discussion
An upstream system is emitting change data capture (CDC) logs that are being written to a cloud object storage directory. Each record in the log indicates the change type (insert, update, or delete) and the values for each field after the change. The source table has a primary key identified by the field pk_id.
For auditing purposes, the data governance team wishes to maintain a full record of all values that have ever been valid in the source system. For analytical purposes, only the most recent value for each record needs to be recorded. The Databricks job to ingest these records occurs once per hour, but each individual record may have changed multiple times over the course of an hour.
Which solution meets these requirements?
A. Create a separate history table for each pk_id resolve the current state of the table by running a union all filtering the history tables for the most recent state.
B. Use MERGE INTO to insert, update, or delete the most recent entry for each pk_id into a bronze table, then propagate all changes throughout the system.
C. Iterate through an ordered set of changes to the table, applying each in turn; rely on Delta Lake's versioning ability to create an audit log.
D. Use Delta Lake's change data feed to automatically process CDC data from an external system, propagating all changes to all dependent tables in the Lakehouse.
E. Ingest all log information into a bronze table; use MERGE INTO to insert, update, or delete the most recent entry for each pk_id into a silver table to recreate the current table state.

******************************
Highly Voted comment found!
E.
This is the correct answer because it meets the requirements of maintaining a full record of all values that have ever been valid in the source system and recreating the current table state with only the most recent value for each record. The code ingests all log information into a bronze table, which preserves the raw CDC data as it is. Then, it uses merge into to perform an upsert operation on a silver table, which means it will insert new records or update or delete existing records based on the change type and the pk_id columns. This way, the silver table will always reflect the current state of the source table, while the bronze table will keep the history of all changes.

Exam Certified Data Engineer Professional topic 1 question 14 discussion
An hourly batch job is configured to ingest data files from a cloud object storage container where each batch represent all records produced by the source system in a given hour. The batch job to process these records into the Lakehouse is sufficiently delayed to ensure no late-arriving data is missed. The user_id field represents a unique key for the data, which has the following schema: user_id BIGINT, username STRING, user_utc STRING, user_region STRING, last_login BIGINT, auto_pay BOOLEAN, last_updated BIGINT
New records are all ingested into a table named account_history which maintains a full record of all data in the same schema as the source. The next table in the system is named account_current and is implemented as a Type 1 table representing the most recent value for each unique user_id.
Assuming there are millions of user accounts and tens of thousands of records processed hourly, which implementation can be used to efficiently update the described account_current table as part of each hourly batch job?
A. Use Auto Loader to subscribe to new files in the account_history directory; configure a Structured Streaming trigger once job to batch update newly detected files into the account_current table.
B. Overwrite the account_current table with each batch using the results of a query against the account_history table grouping by user_id and filtering for the max value of last_updated.
C. Filter records in account_history using the last_updated field and the most recent hour processed, as well as the max last_iogin by user_id write a merge statement to update or insert the most recent value for each user_id.
D. Use Delta Lake version history to get the difference between the latest version of account_history and one version prior, then write these records to account_current.
E. Filter records in account_history using the last_updated field and the most recent hour processed, making sure to deduplicate on username; write a merge statement to update or insert the most recent value for each username.

Highly Voted comment found!
My reasoning is thus:
The application is based on batch processes, so A is wrong.
Overwriting the table would destroy the Type 1 SCD behavior, so B is wrong.
Comparing versions of account_history would not be efficient, as the whole data would be scanned, so D is wrong. 'username' is not a key column, so we have no guarantee that it's unique, thus de-duplicating by it can yield wrongly grouped sets of rows, so E is not a safe bet, with the information we know.
C is the best option.

Exam Certified Data Engineer Professional topic 1 question 15 discussion
A table in the Lakehouse named customer_churn_params is used in churn prediction by the machine learning team. The table contains information about customers derived from a number of upstream sources. Currently, the data engineering team populates this table nightly by overwriting the table with the current valid values derived from upstream data sources.
The churn prediction model used by the ML team is fairly stable in production. The team is only interested in making predictions on records that have changed in the past 24 hours.
Which approach would simplify the identification of these changed records?
A. Apply the churn model to all rows in the customer_churn_params table, but implement logic to perform an upsert into the predictions table that ignores rows where predictions have not changed.
B. Convert the batch job to a Structured Streaming job using the complete output mode; configure a Structured Streaming job to read from the customer_churn_params table and incrementally predict against the churn model.
C. Calculate the difference between the previous model predictions and the current customer_churn_params on a key identifying unique customers before making new predictions; only make predictions on those customers not in the previous predictions.
D. Modify the overwrite logic to include a field populated by calling spark.sql.functions.current_timestamp() as data are being written; use this field to identify records written on a particular date.
E. Replace the current overwrite logic with a merge statement to modify only those records that have changed; write logic to make predictions on the changed records identified by the change data feed.

Exam Certified Data Engineer Professional topic 1 question 21 discussion
A Structured Streaming job deployed to production has been experiencing delays during peak hours of the day. At present, during normal execution, each microbatch of data is processed in less than 3 seconds. During peak hours of the day, execution time for each microbatch becomes very inconsistent, sometimes exceeding 30 seconds. The streaming write is currently configured with a trigger interval of 10 seconds.
Holding all other variables constant and assuming records need to be processed in less than 10 seconds, which adjustment will meet the requirement?
A. Decrease the trigger interval to 5 seconds; triggering batches more frequently allows idle executors to begin processing the next batch while longer running tasks from previous batches finish.
B. Increase the trigger interval to 30 seconds; setting the trigger interval near the maximum execution time observed for each batch is always best practice to ensure no records are dropped.
C. The trigger interval cannot be modified without modifying the checkpoint directory; to maintain the current stream state, increase the number of shuffle partitions to maximize parallelism.
D. Use the trigger once option and configure a Databricks job to execute the query every 10 seconds; this ensures all backlogged records are processed with each batch.
E. Decrease the trigger interval to 5 seconds; triggering batches more frequently may prevent records from backing up and large batches from causing spill.

Highly Voted comment found!
I believe this is a case of the least bad option, not exactly the best option possible.

- A is wrong because in Streaming you very rarely have any executors idle, as all cores are engaged in processing the window of data;
- B is wrong because triggering every 30s will not meet the 10s target processing interval;
- C is wrong in two manners: increasing shuffle partitions to any number above the number of available cores in the cluster will worsen performance in streaming; also, the checkpoint folder has no connection with trigger time.
- D is wrong because, keeping all other things the same as described by the problem, keeping the trigger time as 10s will not change the underlying conditions of the delay (i.e.: too much data to be processed in a timely manner).

E is the only option that might improve processing time.

Which statement describes Delta Lake Auto Compaction?
A. An asynchronous job runs after the write completes to detect if files could be further compacted; if yes, an OPTIMIZE job is executed toward a default of 1 GB.
B. Before a Jobs cluster terminates, OPTIMIZE is executed on all tables modified during the most recent job.
C. Optimized writes use logical partitions instead of directory partitions; because partition boundaries are only represented in metadata, fewer small files are written.
D. Data is queued in a messaging bus instead of committing data directly to memory; all data is committed from the messaging bus in one batch once the job is complete.
E. An asynchronous job runs after the write completes to detect if files could be further compacted; if yes, an OPTIMIZE job is executed toward a default of 128 MB.

Highly Voted comment found!
Delta Lake's Auto Compaction feature is designed to improve the efficiency of data storage by reducing the number of small files in a Delta table. After data is written to a Delta table, an asynchronous job can be triggered to evaluate the file sizes. If it determines that there are a significant number of small files, it will automatically run the OPTIMIZE command, which coalesces these small files into larger ones, typically aiming for files around 1 GB in size for optimal performance.

E is incorrect because the statement is similar to A but with an incorrect default file size target.

A new data engineer notices that a critical field was omitted from an application that writes its Kafka source to Delta Lake. This happened even though the critical field was in the Kafka source. That field was further missing from data written to dependent, long-term storage. The retention threshold on the Kafka service is seven days. The pipeline has been in production for three months.
Which describes how Delta Lake can help to avoid data loss of this nature in the future?
A. The Delta log and Structured Streaming checkpoints record the full history of the Kafka producer.
B. Delta Lake schema evolution can retroactively calculate the correct value for newly added fields, as long as the data was in the original source.
C. Delta Lake automatically checks that all fields present in the source data are included in the ingestion layer.
D. Data can never be permanently dropped or deleted from Delta Lake, so data loss is not possible under any circumstance.
E. Ingesting all raw data and metadata from Kafka to a bronze Delta table creates a permanent, replayable history of the data state.

A junior data engineer is working to implement logic for a Lakehouse table named silver_device_recordings. The source data contains 100 unique fields in a highly nested JSON structure.
The silver_device_recordings table will be used downstream to power several production monitoring dashboards and a production model. At present, 45 of the 100 fields are being used in at least one of these applications.
The data engineer is trying to determine the best approach for dealing with schema declaration given the highly-nested structure of the data and the numerous fields.
Which of the following accurately presents information about Delta Lake and Databricks that may impact their decision-making process?
A. The Tungsten encoding used by Databricks is optimized for storing string data; newly-added native support for querying JSON strings means that string types are always most efficient.
B. Because Delta Lake uses Parquet for data storage, data types can be easily evolved by just modifying file footer information in place.
C. Human labor in writing code is the largest cost associated with data engineering workloads; as such, automating table declaration logic should be a priority in all migration workloads.
D. Because Databricks will infer schema using types that allow all observed data to be processed, setting types manually provides greater assurance of data quality enforcement.
E. Schema inference and evolution on Databricks ensure that inferred types will always accurately match the data types used by downstream systems.

Highly Voted comment found!
A is wrong, because Tungsten is a project around improving Spark's efficiency on memory and CPU usage;
B is wrong because Parquet does not support file editing, it only supports overwrite and create operations by itself;
C is wrong because completely automating schema declaration for tables will incur in reduced previsibility for data types and data quality;
E is false because unlucky sampling can yield bad inferences by Spark;

There is a new option stating like "delta lake indexes first 32column in delta log for Z order and optimization"(not sure I remember exactly, it looks statementfully correct). and I chosed this "new" option.

Exam Certified Data Engineer Professional topic 1 question 33 discussion
The data engineering team is migrating an enterprise system with thousands of tables and views into the Lakehouse. They plan to implement the target architecture using a series of bronze, silver, and gold tables. Bronze tables will almost exclusively be used by production data engineering workloads, while silver tables will be used to support both data engineering and machine learning workloads. Gold tables will largely serve business intelligence and reporting purposes. While personal identifying information (PII) exists in all tiers of data, pseudonymization and anonymization rules are in place for all data at the silver and gold levels.
The organization is interested in reducing security concerns while maximizing the ability to collaborate across diverse teams.
Which statement exemplifies best practices for implementing this system?
A. Isolating tables in separate databases based on data quality tiers allows for easy permissions management through database ACLs and allows physical separation of default storage locations for managed tables.
B. Because databases on Databricks are merely a logical construct, choices around database organization do not impact security or discoverability in the Lakehouse.
C. Storing all production tables in a single database provides a unified view of all data assets available throughout the Lakehouse, simplifying discoverability by granting all users view privileges on this database.
D. Working in the default Databricks database provides the greatest security when working with managed tables, as these will be created in the DBFS root.
E. Because all tables must live in the same storage containers used for the database they're created in, organizations should be prepared to create between dozens and thousands of databases depending on their data isolation requirements.

To reduce storage and compute costs, the data engineering team has been tasked with curating a series of aggregate tables leveraged by business intelligence dashboards, customer-facing applications, production machine learning models, and ad hoc analytical queries.
The data engineering team has been made aware of new requirements from a customer-facing application, which is the only downstream workload they manage entirely. As a result, an aggregate table used by numerous teams across the organization will need to have a number of fields renamed, and additional fields will also be added.
Which of the solutions addresses the situation while minimally interrupting other teams in the organization without increasing the number of tables that need to be managed?
A. Send all users notice that the schema for the table will be changing; include in the communication the logic necessary to revert the new table schema to match historic queries.
B. Configure a new table with all the requisite fields and new names and use this as the source for the customer-facing application; create a view that maintains the original data schema and table name by aliasing select fields from the new table.
C. Create a new table with the required schema and new fields and use Delta Lake's deep clone functionality to sync up changes committed to one table to the corresponding table.
D. Replace the current table definition with a logical view defined with the query logic currently writing the aggregate table; create a new table to power the customer-facing application.
E. Add a table comment warning all users that the table schema and field names will be changing on a given date; overwrite the table in place to the specifications of the customer-facing application.

A small company based in the United States has recently contracted a consulting firm in India to implement several new data engineering pipelines to power artificial intelligence applications. All the company's data is stored in regional cloud storage in the United States.
The workspace administrator at the company is uncertain about where the Databricks workspace used by the contractors should be deployed.
Assuming that all data governance considerations are accounted for, which statement accurately informs this decision?
A. Databricks runs HDFS on cloud volume storage; as such, cloud virtual machines must be deployed in the region where the data is stored.
B. Databricks workspaces do not rely on any regional infrastructure; as such, the decision should be made based upon what is most convenient for the workspace administrator.
C. Cross-region reads and writes can incur significant costs and latency; whenever possible, compute should be deployed in the same region the data is stored.
D. Databricks leverages user workstations as the driver during interactive development; as such, users should always use a workspace deployed in a region they are physically near.
E. Databricks notebooks send all executable code from the user’s browser to virtual machines over the open internet; whenever possible, choosing a workspace region near the end users is the most secure.

A. Because another team uses this table to support a frequently running application, two-phase locking is preventing the operation from committing.
B. The activity_details table already exists; CHECK constraints can only be added during initial table creation.
C. The activity_details table already contains records that violate the constraints; all existing data must pass CHECK constraints in order to add them to an existing table.
D. The activity_details table already contains records; CHECK constraints can only be added prior to inserting values into a table.

A user new to Databricks is trying to troubleshoot long execution times for some pipeline logic they are working on. Presently, the user is executing code cell-by-cell, using display() calls to confirm code is producing the logically correct results as new transformations are added to an operation. To get a measure of average time to execute, the user is running each cell multiple times interactively.
Which of the following adjustments will get a more accurate measure of how code is likely to perform in production?
A. Scala is the only language that can be accurately tested using interactive notebooks; because the best performance is achieved by using Scala code compiled to JARs, all PySpark and Spark SQL logic should be refactored.
B. The only way to meaningfully troubleshoot code execution times in development notebooks Is to use production-sized data and production-sized clusters with Run All execution.
C. Production code development should only be done using an IDE; executing code against a local build of open source Spark and Delta Lake will provide the most accurate benchmarks for how code will perform in production.
D. Calling display() forces a job to trigger, while many transformations will only add to the logical query plan; because of caching, repeated execution of the same logic does not provide meaningful results.
E. The Jobs UI should be leveraged to occasionally run the notebook as a job and track execution time during incremental code development because Photon can only be enabled on clusters launched for scheduled jobs.

A Databricks job has been configured with 3 tasks, each of which is a Databricks notebook. Task A does not depend on other tasks. Tasks B and C run in parallel, with each having a serial dependency on task A.
If tasks A and B complete successfully but task C fails during a scheduled run, which statement describes the resulting state?
A. All logic expressed in the notebook associated with tasks A and B will have been successfully completed; some operations in task C may have completed successfully.
B. All logic expressed in the notebook associated with tasks A and B will have been successfully completed; any changes made in task C will be rolled back due to task failure.
C. All logic expressed in the notebook associated with task A will have been successfully completed; tasks B and C will not commit any changes because of stage failure.

Highly Voted comment found!
When scheduling a Databricks notebook as a job, it's generally recommended to remove or modify commands that involve displaying output, such as using the display() function. Displaying data using display() is an interactive feature designed for exploration and visualization within the notebook interface and may not work well in a production job context.

The finalDF.explain() command, which provides the execution plan of the DataFrame transformations and actions, is often useful for debugging and optimizing queries. While it doesn't display interactive visualizations like display(), it can still be informative for understanding how Spark is executing the operations on your DataFrame.

Highly Voted comment found!
Delta Lake maintains a transaction log that records details about every change made to a table. When you execute a count operation on a Delta table, Delta Lake can use the information in the transaction log to calculate the total number of records without having to scan all the data files. This is because the transaction log includes information about the number of records in each file, allowing for an efficient aggregation of these counts to get the total number of records in the table.

E. %sh executes shell code on the driver node. The code does not take advantage of the worker nodes or Databricks optimized Spark.

Highly Voted comment found!
When using %sh in a Databricks notebook, the commands are executed in a shell environment on the driver node. This means that only the resources of the driver node are used, and the execution does not leverage the distributed computing capabilities of the worker nodes in the Spark cluster. This can result in slower performance, especially for data-intensive tasks, compared to an approach that distributes the workload across all nodes in the cluster using Spark.

A. Delta Lake statistics are not optimized for free text fields with high cardinality.
B. Text data cannot be stored with Delta Lake.
C. ZORDER ON review will need to be run to see performance gains.
D. The Delta log creates a term matrix for free text fields to support selective filtering.
E. Delta Lake statistics are only collected on the first 4 columns in a table.

Highly Voted comment found!
Delta Lake uses statistics and data skipping to improve query performance, but these optimizations are most effective for columns with low to medium cardinality (i.e., columns with a limited set of distinct values). Free-form text fields like the review column typically have high cardinality, meaning each value in the column (each review text) is unique or nearly unique. Consequently, statistics on such columns do not significantly improve the performance of queries searching for specific keywords within the text.

A data ingestion task requires a one-TB JSON dataset to be written out to Parquet with a target part-file size of 512 MB. Because Parquet is being used instead of Delta Lake, built-in file-sizing features such as Auto-Optimize & Auto-Compaction cannot be used.
Which strategy will yield the best performance without shuffling data?
A. Set spark.sql.files.maxPartitionBytes to 512 MB, ingest the data, execute the narrow transformations, and then write to parquet.
B. Set spark.sql.shuffle.partitions to 2,048 partitions (1TB*1024*1024/512), ingest the data, execute the narrow transformations, optimize the data by sorting it (which automatically repartitions the data), and then write to parquet.
C. Set spark.sql.adaptive.advisoryPartitionSizeInBytes to 512 MB bytes, ingest the data, execute the narrow transformations, coalesce to 2,048 partitions (1TB*1024*1024/512), and then write to parquet.
D. Ingest the data, execute the narrow transformations, repartition to 2,048 partitions (1TB* 1024*1024/512), and then write to parquet.
E. Set spark.sql.shuffle.partitions to 512, ingest the data, execute the narrow transformations, and then write to parquet.

Highly Voted comment found!
This strategy aims to control the size of the output Parquet files without shuffling the data. The spark.sql.files.maxPartitionBytes parameter sets the maximum size of a partition that Spark will read. By setting it to 512 MB, you are aligning the read partition size with the desired output file size. Since the transformations are narrow (meaning they do not require shuffling), the number of partitions should roughly correspond to the number of output files when writing out to Parquet, assuming the data is evenly distributed and there is no data expansion during processing.
******************************

D is the only one that does the trick.

Note, we can not do shuffling.

Wrong answers:

A: spark.sql.files.maxPartitionBytes is about reading, not writing.(The maximum number of bytes to pack into a single partition when reading files. This configuration is effective only when using file-based sources such as Parquet, JSON and ORC. )

B: spark.sql.adaptive.advisoryPartitionSizeInBytes takes effect while shuffling and sorting does not make sense (The advisory size in bytes of the shuffle partition during adaptive optimization (when spark.sql.adaptive.enabled is true). It takes effect when Spark coalesces small shuffle partitions or splits skewed shuffle partition.)

C: Would work but spark.sql.adaptive.advisoryPartitionSizeInBytes would need shuffling.

E. spark.sql.shuffle.partitions (Configures the number of partitions to use when shuffling data for joins or aggregations.) is not about writing.

Answer A. When updating the schema of a streaming job by adding new fields (like the new_member_promo field), it’s important to use a new checkpoint location. This is because the existing checkpoint location is tied to the old schema, and adding a new field could lead to schema mismatch issues.

Exam Certified Data Engineer Professional topic 1 question 73 discussion
A Structured Streaming job deployed to production has been resulting in higher than expected cloud storage costs. At present, during normal execution, each microbatch of data is processed in less than 3s; at least 12 times per minute, a microbatch is processed that contains 0 records. The streaming write was configured using the default trigger settings. The production job is currently scheduled alongside many other Databricks jobs in a workspace with instance pools provisioned to reduce start-up time for jobs with batch execution.
Holding all other variables constant and assuming records need to be processed in less than 10 minutes, which adjustment will meet the requirement?
A. Set the trigger interval to 3 seconds; the default trigger interval is consuming too many records per batch, resulting in spill to disk that can increase volume costs.
B. Increase the number of shuffle partitions to maximize parallelism, since the trigger interval cannot be modified without modifying the checkpoint directory.
C. Set the trigger interval to 10 minutes; each batch calls APIs in the source storage account, so decreasing trigger frequency to maximum allowable threshold should minimize this cost.
D. Set the trigger interval to 500 milliseconds; setting a small but non-zero trigger interval ensures that the source is not queried too frequently.
E. Use the trigger once option and configure a Databricks job to execute the query every 10 minutes; this approach minimizes costs for both compute and storage.

When the schema of a Delta table is updated to include new fields, these fields will only be populated for new records ingested after the schema update. The new fields will not be retroactively computed for historic records already stored in the Delta table.

In Delta Lake, an external (or unmanaged) table is a table created outside of the data lake but is still accessible from the data lake. The data for external tables is stored in a location specified by the user, not in the default directory of the data lake. When you save data to an external table, you need to specify the full file path where the data will be stored. This makes the table “external” because the data itself is not managed by Delta Lake, only the metadata is. This is why specifying a full file path alongside the Delta format when saving data to a table will ensure that the table is configured as an external Delta Lake table.

In systems that support atomic transactions, such as Delta Lake, when a batch operation encounters a record that violates a CHECK constraint, the entire operation fails, and no records are inserted, including those that do not violate the constraint. This is to ensure the atomicity of the transaction, meaning that either all the changes are committed, or none are, maintaining data integrity. The record with a longitude of 212.67 violates the constraint because longitude values must be between -180 and 180 degrees.

In Delta Lake, when a batch job attempts to insert records into a table that has a CHECK constraint, if any record violates the constraint, the entire write operation fails. This is because Delta Lake enforces strong transactional guarantees, which means that either all changes in a transaction are saved, or none are.

A. Databricks jobs must have exactly one owner; "Owner" privileges cannot be assigned to a group.
B. The creator of a Databricks job will always have "Owner" privileges; this configuration cannot be changed.
C. Other than the default "admins" group, only individual users can be granted privileges on jobs.
D. A user can only transfer job ownership to a group if they are also a member of that group.

All records from an Apache Kafka producer are being ingested into a single Delta Lake table with the following schema:
key BINARY, value BINARY, topic STRING, partition LONG, offset LONG, timestamp LONG
There are 5 unique topics being ingested. Only the "registration" topic contains Personal Identifiable Information (PII). The company wishes to restrict access to PII. The company also wishes to only retain records containing PII in this table for 14 days after initial ingestion. However, for non-PII information, it would like to retain these records indefinitely.
Which of the following solutions meets the requirements?
A. All data should be deleted biweekly; Delta Lake's time travel functionality should be leveraged to maintain a history of non-PII information.
B. Data should be partitioned by the registration field, allowing ACLs and delete statements to be set for the PII directory.
C. Because the value field is stored as binary data, this information is not considered PII and no special precautions should be taken.
D. Separate object storage containers should be specified based on the partition field, allowing isolation at the storage level.
E. Data should be partitioned by the topic field, allowing ACLs and delete statements to leverage partition boundaries.

In order to prevent accidental commits to production data, a senior data engineer has instituted a policy that all development work will reference clones of Delta Lake tables. After testing both DEEP and SHALLOW CLONE, development tables are created using SHALLOW CLONE.
A few weeks after initial table creation, the cloned versions of several tables implemented as Type 1 Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD) stop working. The transaction logs for the source tables show that VACUUM was run the day before.
Which statement describes why the cloned tables are no longer working?
A. Because Type 1 changes overwrite existing records, Delta Lake cannot guarantee data consistency for cloned tables.
B. Running VACUUM automatically invalidates any shallow clones of a table; DEEP CLONE should always be used when a cloned table will be repeatedly queried.
C. Tables created with SHALLOW CLONE are automatically deleted after their default retention threshold of 7 days.
D. The metadata created by the CLONE operation is referencing data files that were purged as invalid by the VACUUM command.
E. The data files compacted by VACUUM are not tracked by the cloned metadata; running REFRESH on the cloned table will pull in recent changes.

Highly Voted comment found!
Shallow clone: only duplicates the metadata of the table being cloned; the data files of the table itself are not copied. These clones are cheaper to create but are  not self-contained and depend on the source from which they were cloned as the source of data. If the files in the source that the clone depends on are removed, for example with VACUUM, a shallow clone may become unusable. Therefore, shallow clones are typically used for short-lived use cases such as testing and experimentation.

In the Spark UI, the Stage’s detail screen provides key metrics about each stage of a job, including the amount of data that has been spilled to disk. If you see a high number in the “Spill (Memory)” or “Spill (Disk)” columns, it’s an indication that a partition is spilling to disk.

The Executor’s log files can also provide valuable information about spill. If a task is spilling a lot of data, you’ll see messages in the logs like “Spilling UnsafeExternalSorter to disk” or “Task memory spill”. These messages indicate that the task ran out of memory and had to spill data to disk.

A junior data engineer is migrating a workload from a relational database system to the Databricks Lakehouse. The source system uses a star schema, leveraging foreign key constraints and multi-table inserts to validate records on write.
Which consideration will impact the decisions made by the engineer while migrating this workload?
A. Databricks only allows foreign key constraints on hashed identifiers, which avoid collisions in highly-parallel writes.
B. Databricks supports Spark SQL and JDBC; all logic can be directly migrated from the source system without refactoring.
C. Committing to multiple tables simultaneously requires taking out multiple table locks and can lead to a state of deadlock.
D. All Delta Lake transactions are ACID compliant against a single table, and Databricks does not enforce foreign key constraints.
E. Foreign keys must reference a primary key field; multi-table inserts must leverage Delta Lake’s upsert functionality.

Highly Voted comment found!
In Databricks Delta Lake, transactions are ACID compliant at the table level, meaning that transactions apply to a single table. However, Delta Lake does not enforce foreign key constraints across tables. Therefore, the data engineer needs to be aware that Databricks does not automatically enforce referential integrity between tables through foreign key constraints, and it becomes the responsibility of the data engineer to manage these relationships appropriately.

A data architect has heard about Delta Lake’s built-in versioning and time travel capabilities. For auditing purposes, they have a requirement to maintain a full record of all valid street addresses as they appear in the customers table.
The architect is interested in implementing a Type 1 table, overwriting existing records with new values and relying on Delta Lake time travel to support long-term auditing. A data engineer on the project feels that a Type 2 table will provide better performance and scalability.
Which piece of information is critical to this decision?
A. Data corruption can occur if a query fails in a partially completed state because Type 2 tables require setting multiple fields in a single update.
B. Shallow clones can be combined with Type 1 tables to accelerate historic queries for long-term versioning.
C. Delta Lake time travel cannot be used to query previous versions of these tables because Type 1 changes modify data files in place.
D. Delta Lake time travel does not scale well in cost or latency to provide a long-term versioning solution.
E. Delta Lake only supports Type 0 tables; once records are inserted to a Delta Lake table, they cannot be modified.

A. Size on Disk is < Size in Memory
B. The RDD Block Name includes the “*” annotation signaling a failure to cache

C. Size on Disk is > 0

When using Spark's MEMORY_ONLY storage level, the ideal scenario is that the data is fully cached in memory, and the Size on Disk should be 0 (indicating that the data is not spilled to disk). If the Size on Disk is greater than 0, it suggests that some data has been spilled to disk, which can lead to degraded performance as reading from disk is slower than reading from memory.

Original query:
https://img.examtopics.com/certified-data-engineer-professional/image49.png
Proposed query:
https://img.examtopics.com/certified-data-engineer-professional/image50.png
Which step must also be completed to put the proposed query into production?
A. Specify a new checkpointLocation
B. Remove .option('mergeSchema', 'true') from the streaming write
C. Increase the shuffle partitions to account for additional aggregates
D. Run REFRESH TABLE delta.‛/item_agg‛

Highly Voted comment found!
Answer: A
When updating the schema of a streaming job, specifying a new checkpoint location ensures that the streaming query starts fresh with the new schema. This avoids issues that might arise from schema mismatches between the previous state and the new schema. This is especially relevant when adding new fields because the existing state might not be compatible with the new schema.

Exam Certified Data Engineer Professional topic 1 question 116 discussion
The data engineering team is configuring environments for development, testing, and production before beginning migration on a new data pipeline. The team requires extensive testing on both the code and data resulting from code execution, and the team wants to develop and test against data as similar to production data as possible.
A junior data engineer suggests that production data can be mounted to the development and testing environments, allowing pre-production code to execute against production data. Because all users have admin privileges in the development environment, the junior data engineer has offered to configure permissions and mount this data for the team.
Which statement captures best practices for this situation?
A. All development, testing, and production code and data should exist in a single, unified workspace; creating separate environments for testing and development complicates administrative overhead.
B. In environments where interactive code will be executed, production data should only be accessible with read permissions; creating isolated databases for each environment further reduces risks.
C. As long as code in the development environment declares USE dev_db at the top of each notebook, there is no possibility of inadvertently committing changes back to production data sources.
D. Because Delta Lake versions all data and supports time travel, it is not possible for user error or malicious actors to permanently delete production data; as such, it is generally safe to mount production data anywhere.
E. Because access to production data will always be verified using passthrough credentials, it is safe to mount data to any Databricks development environment.

The data engineering team has configured a job to process customer requests to be forgotten (have their data deleted). All user data that needs to be deleted is stored in Delta Lake tables using default table settings.
The team has decided to process all deletions from the previous week as a batch job at 1am each Sunday. The total duration of this job is less than one hour. Every Monday at 3am, a batch job executes a series of VACUUM commands on all Delta Lake tables throughout the organization.
The compliance officer has recently learned about Delta Lake's time travel functionality. They are concerned that this might allow continued access to deleted data.
Assuming all delete logic is correctly implemented, which statement correctly addresses this concern?
A. Because the VACUUM command permanently deletes all files containing deleted records, deleted records may be accessible with time travel for around 24 hours.
B. Because the default data retention threshold is 24 hours, data files containing deleted records will be retained until the VACUUM job is run the following day.
C. Because the default data retention threshold is 7 days, data files containing deleted records will be retained until the VACUUM job is run 8 days later.
D. Because Delta Lake's delete statements have ACID guarantees, deleted records will be permanently purged from all storage systems as soon as a delete job completes.

A. The update throws an error because changes to existing columns in the target schema are not supported.
B. The new nested Field is added to the target schema, and dynamically read as NULL for existing unmatched records.
C. The update is moved to a separate "rescued" column because it is missing a column expected in the target schema.
D. The new nested field is added to the target schema, and files underlying existing records are updated to include NULL values for the new field.

Highly Voted comment found!
Correct Answer: B. 
In the question it is mentioned that the schema evolution is enabled. This option states that the new nested field is added to the target schema, and existing records not matching the new schema format are populated with NULL for the newly added columns. This behavior aligns with how schema evolution functions in Delta Lake, dynamically adapting the schema to include new fields.

Exam Certified Data Engineer Professional topic 1 question 131 discussion
An upstream system is emitting change data capture (CDC) logs that are being written to a cloud object storage directory. Each record in the log indicates the change type (insert, update, or delete) and the values for each field after the change. The source table has a primary key identified by the field pk_id.
For auditing purposes, the data governance team wishes to maintain a full record of all values that have ever been valid in the source system. For analytical purposes, only the most recent value for each record needs to be recorded. The Databricks job to ingest these records occurs once per hour, but each individual record may have changed multiple times over the course of an hour.
Which solution meets these requirements?
A. Iterate through an ordered set of changes to the table, applying each in turn to create the current state of the table, (insert, update, delete), timestamp of change, and the values.
B. Use merge into to insert, update, or delete the most recent entry for each pk_id into a table, then propagate all changes throughout the system.
C. Deduplicate records in each batch by pk_id and overwrite the target table.
D. Use Delta Lake’s change data feed to automatically process CDC data from an external system, propagating all changes to all dependent tables in the Lakehouse.

Exam Certified Data Engineer Professional topic 1 question 132 discussion
An hourly batch job is configured to ingest data files from a cloud object storage container where each batch represent all records produced by the source system in a given hour. The batch job to process these records into the Lakehouse is sufficiently delayed to ensure no late-arriving data is missed. The user_id field represents a unique key for the data, which has the following schema:
user_id BIGINT, username STRING, user_utc STRING, user_region STRING, last_login BIGINT, auto_pay BOOLEAN, last_updated BIGINT
New records are all ingested into a table named account_history which maintains a full record of all data in the same schema as the source. The next table in the system is named account_current and is implemented as a Type 1 table representing the most recent value for each unique user_id.
Which implementation can be used to efficiently update the described account_current table as part of each hourly batch job assuming there are millions of user accounts and tens of thousands of records processed hourly?
A. Filter records in account_history using the last_updated field and the most recent hour processed, making sure to deduplicate on username; write a merge statement to update or insert the most recent value for each username.
B. Use Auto Loader to subscribe to new files in the account_history directory; configure a Structured Streaming trigger available job to batch update newly detected files into the account_current table.
C. Overwrite the account_current table with each batch using the results of a query against the account_history table grouping by user_id and filtering for the max value of last_updated.
D. Filter records in account_history using the last_updated field and the most recent hour processed, as well as the max last_login by user_id write a merge statement to update or insert the most recent value for each user_id.

A. All logic will execute when the view is defined and store the result of joining tables to the DBFS; this stored data will be returned when the view is queried.
B. Results will be computed and cached when the view is defined; these cached results will incrementally update as new records are inserted into source tables.
C. All logic will execute at query time and return the result of joining the valid versions of the source tables at the time the query finishes.
D. All logic will execute at query time and return the result of joining the valid versions of the source tables at the time the query began.

Highly Voted comment found!
Correct Answer: D
Correct because this option correctly describes the behavior of SQL views in Databricks. The view's query is executed against the current state of the data in the source tables at the moment the query begins. This means that any changes to the data that are committed while the query is running will not be reflected in the results of the query currently executing.

Correct Answer: B
The Change Data Feed (CDF) feature in Delta Lake enables reading only the changes (inserts and updates) to a Delta table. This would allow the function to focus on new or modified data since the last trigger, making it ideal for processing only the new records that have not been processed yet. This directly meets the requirement for identifying and manipulating new records efficiently.

Which statement captures best practices for this situation?
A. All development, testing, and production code and data should exist in a single, unified workspace; creating separate environments for testing and development complicates administrative overhead.
B. In environments where interactive code will be executed, production data should only be accessible with read permissions; creating isolated databases for each environment further reduces risks.
C. Because access to production data will always be verified using passthrough credentials, it is safe to mount data to any Databricks development environment.
D. Because Delta Lake versions all data and supports time travel, it is not possible for user error or malicious actors to permanently delete production data; as such, it is generally safe to mount production data anywhere.

A small company based in the United States has recently contracted a consulting firm in India to implement several new data engineering pipelines to power artificial intelligence applications. All the company's data is stored in regional cloud storage in the United States.
The workspace administrator at the company is uncertain about where the Databricks workspace used by the contractors should be deployed.
Assuming that all data governance considerations are accounted for, which statement accurately informs this decision?
A. Databricks runs HDFS on cloud volume storage; as such, cloud virtual machines must be deployed in the region where the data is stored.
B. Databricks workspaces do not rely on any regional infrastructure; as such, the decision should be made based upon what is most convenient for the workspace administrator.
C. Cross-region reads and writes can incur significant costs and latency; whenever possible, compute should be deployed in the same region the data is stored.
D. Databricks notebooks send all executable code from the user’s browser to virtual machines over the open internet; whenever possible, choosing a workspace region near the end users is the most secure.

A user new to Databricks is trying to troubleshoot long execution times for some pipeline logic they are working on. Presently, the user is executing code cell-by-cell, using display() calls to confirm code is producing the logically correct results as new transformations are added to an operation. To get a measure of average time to execute, the user is running each cell multiple times interactively.
Which of the following adjustments will get a more accurate measure of how code is likely to perform in production?
A. The Jobs UI should be leveraged to occasionally run the notebook as a job and track execution time during incremental code development because Photon can only be enabled on clusters launched for scheduled jobs.
B. The only way to meaningfully troubleshoot code execution times in development notebooks is to use production-sized data and production-sized clusters with Run All execution.
C. Production code development should only be done using an IDE; executing code against a local build of open source Spark and Delta Lake will provide the most accurate benchmarks for how code will perform in production.
D. Calling display() forces a job to trigger, while many transformations will only add to the logical query plan; because of caching, repeated execution of the same logic does not provide meaningful results.
