Overview. Company Overview -
Contoso, Ltd. is an online retail company that wants to modernize its analytics platform by moving to Fabric. The company plans to begin using Fabric for marketing analytics.
Overview. IT Structure -
The company’s IT department has a team of data analysts and a team of data engineers that use analytics systems.
The data engineers perform the ingestion, transformation, and loading of data. They prefer to use Python or SQL to transform the data.
The data analysts query data and create semantic models and reports. They are qualified to write queries in Power Query and T-SQL.
Existing Environment. Fabric -
Contoso has an F64 capacity named Cap1. All Fabric users are allowed to create items.
Contoso has two workspaces named WorkspaceA and WorkspaceB that currently use Pro license mode.
Existing Environment. Source Systems
Contoso has a point of sale (POS) system named POS1 that uses an instance of SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines in the same Microsoft Entra tenant as Fabric. The host virtual machine is on a private virtual network that has public access blocked. POS1 contains all the sales transactions that were processed on the company’s website.
The company has a software as a service (SaaS) online marketing app named MAR1. MAR1 has seven entities. The entities contain data that relates to email open rates and interaction rates, as well as website interactions. The data can be exported from MAR1 by calling REST APIs. Each entity has a different endpoint.
Contoso has been using MAR1 for one year. Data from prior years is stored in Parquet files in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket. There are 12 files that range in size from 300 MB to 900 MB and relate to email interactions.
Existing Environment. Product Data
POS1 contains a product list and related data. The data comes from the following three tables:
Products -
ProductCategories -
ProductSubcategories -
In the data, products are related to product subcategories, and subcategories are related to product categories.
Existing Environment. Azure -
Contoso has a Microsoft Entra tenant that has the following mail-enabled security groups:
DataAnalysts: Contains the data analysts
DataEngineers: Contains the data engineers
Contoso has an Azure subscription.
The company has an existing Azure DevOps organization and creates a new project for repositories that relate to Fabric.
Existing Environment. User Problems
The VP of marketing at Contoso requires analysis on the effectiveness of different types of email content. It typically takes a week to manually compile and analyze the data. Contoso wants to reduce the time to less than one day by using Fabric.
The data engineering team has successfully exported data from MAR1. The team experiences transient connectivity errors, which causes the data exports to fail.
Requirements. Planned Changes -
Contoso plans to create the following two lakehouses:
Lakehouse1: Will store both raw and cleansed data from the sources
Lakehouse2: Will serve data in a dimensional model to users for analytical queries
Additional items will be added to facilitate data ingestion and transformation.
Contoso plans to use Azure Repos for source control in Fabric.
Requirements. Technical Requirements
The new lakehouses must follow a medallion architecture by using the following three layers: bronze, silver, and gold. There will be extensive data cleansing required to populate the MAR1 data in the silver layer, including deduplication, the handling of missing values, and the standardizing of capitalization.
Each layer must be fully populated before moving on to the next layer. If any step in populating the lakehouses fails, an email must be sent to the data engineers.
Data imports must run simultaneously, when possible.
The use of email data from the Amazon S3 bucket must meet the following requirements:
Minimize egress costs associated with cross-cloud data access.
Prevent saving a copy of the raw data in the lakehouses.
Items that relate to data ingestion must meet the following requirements:
The items must be source controlled alongside other workspace items.
Ingested data must land in the bronze layer of Lakehouse1 in the Delta format.
No changes other than changes to the file formats must be implemented before the data lands in the bronze layer.
Development effort must be minimized and a built-in connection must be used to import the source data.
In the event of a connectivity error, the ingestion processes must attempt the connection again.
Lakehouses, data pipelines, and notebooks must be stored in WorkspaceA. Semantic models, reports, and dataflows must be stored in WorkspaceB.
Once a week, old files that are no longer referenced by a Delta table log must be removed.
Requirements. Data Transformation
In the POS1 product data, ProductID values are unique. The product dimension in the gold layer must include only active products from product list. Active products are identified by an IsActive value of 1.
Some product categories and subcategories are NOT assigned to any product. They are NOT analytically relevant and must be omitted from the product dimension in the gold layer.
Requirements. Data Security -
Security in Fabric must meet the following requirements:
The data engineers must have read and write access to all the lakehouses, including the underlying files.
The data analysts must only have read access to the Delta tables in the gold layer.
The data analysts must NOT have access to the data in the bronze and silver layers.
The data engineers must be able to commit changes to source control in WorkspaceA.
You need to ensure that the data analysts can access the gold layer lakehouse.
What should you do?
A. Add the DataAnalyst group to the Viewer role for WorkspaceA.
B. Share the lakehouse with the DataAnalysts group and grant the Build reports on the default semantic model permission.
C. Share the lakehouse with the DataAnalysts group and grant the Read all SQL Endpoint data permission.
D. Share the lakehouse with the DataAnalysts group and grant the Read all Apache Spark permission.
Highly Voted comment found!
By granting Read all SQL Endpoint data permission, the analysts get the necessary and sufficient access to query the gold layer data while adhering to the principle of least privilege.

The answer is B. No because the "sort by" is sorting values in descending order (default behavior --> https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/kusto/query/sort-operator?view=microsoft-fabric). One should add "asc" to sort values as required. The double "project" at the end does not affect the final result

Overview -
Litware, Inc. is a publishing company that has an online bookstore and several retail bookstores worldwide. Litware also manages an online advertising business for the authors it represents.
Existing Environment. Fabric Environment
Litware has a Fabric workspace named Workspace1. High concurrency is enabled for Workspace1.
The company has a data engineering team that uses Python for data processing.
Existing Environment. Data Processing
The retail bookstores send sales data at the end of each business day, while the online bookstore constantly provides logs and sales data to a central enterprise resource planning (ERP) system.
Litware implements a medallion architecture by using the following three layers: bronze, silver, and gold. The sales data is ingested from the ERP system as Parquet files that land in the Files folder in a lakehouse. Notebooks are used to transform the files in a Delta table for the bronze and silver layers. The gold layer is in a warehouse that has V-Order disabled.
Litware has image files of book covers in Azure Blob Storage. The files are loaded into the Files folder.
Existing Environment. Sales Data
Month-end sales data is processed on the first calendar day of each month. Data that is older than one month never changes.
In the source system, the sales data refreshes every six hours starting at midnight each day.
The sales data is captured in a Dataflow Gen1 dataflow. When the dataflow runs, new and historical data is captured. The dataflow captures the following fields of the source:
• Sales Date
• Author
• Price
• Units
• SKU
A table named AuthorSales stores the sales data that relates to each author. The table contains a column named AuthorEmail. Authors authenticate to a guest Fabric tenant by using their email address.
Existing Environment. Security Groups
Litware has the following security groups:
• Sales
• Fabric Admins
• Streaming Admins
Existing Environment. Performance Issues
Business users perform ad-hoc queries against the warehouse. The business users indicate that reports against the warehouse sometimes run for two hours and fail to load as expected. Upon further investigation, the data engineering team receives the following error message when the reports fail to load: “The SQL query failed while running.”
The data engineering team wants to debug the issue and find queries that cause more than one failure.
When the authors have new book releases, there is often an increase in sales activity. This increase slows the data ingestion process.
The company’s sales team reports that during the last month, the sales data has NOT been up-to-date when they arrive at work in the morning.
Requirements. Planned Changes -
Litware recently signed a contract to receive book reviews. The provider of the reviews exposes the data in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets.
Litware plans to manage Search Engine Optimization (SEO) for the authors. The SEO data will be streamed from a REST API.
Requirements. Version Control -
Litware plans to implement a version control solution in Fabric that will use GitHub integration and follow the principle of least privilege.
Requirements. Governance Requirements
To control data platform costs, the data platform must use only Fabric services and items. Additional Azure resources must NOT be provisioned.
Requirements. Data Requirements -
Litware identifies the following data requirements:
• Process the SEO data in near-real-time (NRT).
• Make the book reviews available in the lakehouse without making a copy of the data.
• When a new book cover image arrives in the Files folder, process the image as soon as possible.
You need to ensure that processes for the bronze and silver layers run in isolation.
How should you configure the Apache Spark settings?
A. Disable high concurrency.
B. Create a custom pool.
C. Modify the number of executors.
D. Set the default environment.

The entities contain data that relates to email open rates and interaction rates, as well as website interactions. The data can be exported from MAR1 by calling REST APIs. Each entity has a different endpoint.
Contoso has been using MAR1 for one year. Data from prior years is stored in Parquet files in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket. There are 12 files that range in size from 300 MB to 900 MB and relate to email interactions.
Existing Environment. Product Data
POS1 contains a product list and related data. The data comes from the following three tables:
• Products
• ProductCategories
• ProductSubcategories
In the data, products are related to product subcategories, and subcategories are related to product categories.
Existing Environment. Azure -
Contoso has a Microsoft Entra tenant that has the following mail-enabled security groups:
• DataAnalysts: Contains the data analysts
• DataEngineers: Contains the data engineers
Contoso has an Azure subscription.
The company has an existing Azure DevOps organization and creates a new project for repositories that relate to Fabric.
Existing Environment. User Problems
The VP of marketing at Contoso requires analysis on the effectiveness of different types of email content. It typically takes a week to manually compile and analyze the data. Contoso wants to reduce the time to less than one day by using Fabric.
The data engineering team has successfully exported data from MAR1. The team experiences transient connectivity errors, which causes the data exports to fail.
Requirements. Planned Changes -
Contoso plans to create the following two lakehouses:
• Lakehouse1: Will store both raw and cleansed data from the sources
• Lakehouse2: Will serve data in a dimensional model to users for analytical queries
Additional items will be added to facilitate data ingestion and transformation.
Contoso plans to use Azure Repos for source control in Fabric.
Requirements. Technical Requirements
The new lakehouses must follow a medallion architecture by using the following three layers: bronze, silver, and gold. There will be extensive data cleansing required to populate the MAR1 data in the silver layer, including deduplication, the handling of missing values, and the standardizing of capitalization.
Each layer must be fully populated before moving on to the next layer. If any step in populating the lakehouses fails, an email must be sent to the data engineers.
Data imports must run simultaneously, when possible.
The use of email data from the Amazon S3 bucket must meet the following requirements:
• Minimize egress costs associated with cross-cloud data access.
• Prevent saving a copy of the raw data in the lakehouses.
Items that relate to data ingestion must meet the following requirements:
• The items must be source controlled alongside other workspace items.
• Ingested data must land in the bronze layer of Lakehouse1 in the Delta format.
• No changes other than changes to the file formats must be implemented before the data lands in the bronze layer.
• Development effort must be minimized and a built-in connection must be used to import the source data.
• In the event of a connectivity error, the ingestion processes must attempt the connection again.
Lakehouses, data pipelines, and notebooks must be stored in WorkspaceA. Semantic models, reports, and dataflows must be stored in WorkspaceB.
Once a week, old files that are no longer referenced by a Delta table log must be removed.
Requirements. Data Transformation
In the POS1 product data, ProductID values are unique. The product dimension in the gold layer must include only active products from product list. Active products are identified by an IsActive value of 1.
Some product categories and subcategories are NOT assigned to any product. They are NOT analytically relevant and must be omitted from the product dimension in the gold layer.
Requirements. Data Security -
Security in Fabric must meet the following requirements:
• The data engineers must have read and write access to all the lakehouses, including the underlying files.
• The data analysts must only have read access to the Delta tables in the gold layer.
• The data analysts must NOT have access to the data in the bronze and silver layers.
• The data engineers must be able to commit changes to source control in WorkspaceA.
You need to ensure that WorkspaceA can be configured for source control.
Which two actions should you perform? Each correct answer presents part of the solution.
NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.
A. From Tenant setting, set Users can synchronize workspace items with their Git repositories to Enabled.
B. From Tenant setting, set Users can sync workspace items with GitHub repositories to Enabled.
C. Configure WorkspaceA to use a Premium Per User (PPU) license.
D. Assign WorkspaceA to Cap1.

The company has a data engineering team that uses Python for data processing.
Existing Environment. Data Processing
The retail bookstores send sales data at the end of each business day, while the online bookstore constantly provides logs and sales data to a central enterprise resource planning (ERP) system.
Litware implements a medallion architecture by using the following three layers: bronze, silver, and gold. The sales data is ingested from the ERP system as Parquet files that land in the Files folder in a lakehouse. Notebooks are used to transform the files in a Delta table for the bronze and silver layers. The gold layer is in a warehouse that has V-Order disabled.
Litware has image files of book covers in Azure Blob Storage. The files are loaded into the Files folder.
Existing Environment. Sales Data
Month-end sales data is processed on the first calendar day of each month. Data that is older than one month never changes.
In the source system, the sales data refreshes every six hours starting at midnight each day.
The sales data is captured in a Dataflow Gen1 dataflow. When the dataflow runs, new and historical data is captured. The dataflow captures the following fields of the source:
Sales Date -
Author -
Price -
Units -
SKU -
A table named AuthorSales stores the sales data that relates to each author. The table contains a column named AuthorEmail. Authors authenticate to a guest Fabric tenant by using their email address.

Overview. Company Overview -
Contoso, Ltd. is an online retail company that wants to modernize its analytics platform by moving to Fabric. The company plans to begin using Fabric for marketing analytics.
Overview. IT Structure -
The company’s IT department has a team of data analysts and a team of data engineers that use analytics systems.
The data engineers perform the ingestion, transformation, and loading of data. They prefer to use Python or SQL to transform the data.
The data analysts query data and create semantic models and reports. They are qualified to write queries in Power Query and T-SQL.
Existing Environment. Fabric -
Contoso has an F64 capacity named Cap1. All Fabric users are allowed to create items.
Contoso has two workspaces named WorkspaceA and WorkspaceB that currently use Pro license mode.
Existing Environment. Source Systems
Contoso has a point of sale (POS) system named POS1 that uses an instance of SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines in the same Microsoft Entra tenant as Fabric. The host virtual machine is on a private virtual network that has public access blocked. POS1 contains all the sales transactions that were processed on the company’s website.
The company has a software as a service (SaaS) online marketing app named MAR1. MAR1 has seven entities. The entities contain data that relates to email open rates and interaction rates, as well as website interactions. The data can be exported from MAR1 by calling REST APIs. Each entity has a different endpoint.
Contoso has been using MAR1 for one year. Data from prior years is stored in Parquet files in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket. There are 12 files that range in size from 300 MB to 900 MB and relate to email interactions.
Existing Environment. Product Data
POS1 contains a product list and related data. The data comes from the following three tables:
Products -
ProductCategories -
ProductSubcategories -
In the data, products are related to product subcategories, and subcategories are related to product categories.

Overview -
Litware, Inc. is a publishing company that has an online bookstore and several retail bookstores worldwide. Litware also manages an online advertising business for the authors it represents.
Existing Environment. Fabric Environment
Litware has a Fabric workspace named Workspace1. High concurrency is enabled for Workspace1.
The company has a data engineering team that uses Python for data processing.
Existing Environment. Data Processing
The retail bookstores send sales data at the end of each business day, while the online bookstore constantly provides logs and sales data to a central enterprise resource planning (ERP) system.
Litware implements a medallion architecture by using the following three layers: bronze, silver, and gold. The sales data is ingested from the ERP system as Parquet files that land in the Files folder in a lakehouse. Notebooks are used to transform the files in a Delta table for the bronze and silver layers. The gold layer is in a warehouse that has V-Order disabled.
Litware has image files of book covers in Azure Blob Storage. The files are loaded into the Files folder.
Existing Environment. Sales Data
Month-end sales data is processed on the first calendar day of each month. Data that is older than one month never changes.
In the source system, the sales data refreshes every six hours starting at midnight each day.
The sales data is captured in a Dataflow Gen1 dataflow. When the dataflow runs, new and historical data is captured. The dataflow captures the following fields of the source:
• Sales Date
• Author
• Price
• Units
• SKU
A table named AuthorSales stores the sales data that relates to each author. The table contains a column named AuthorEmail. Authors authenticate to a guest Fabric tenant by using their email address.
Existing Environment. Security Groups
Litware has the following security groups:
• Sales
• Fabric Admins
• Streaming Admins
Existing Environment. Performance Issues
Business users perform ad-hoc queries against the warehouse. The business users indicate that reports against the warehouse sometimes run for two hours and fail to load as expected. Upon further investigation, the data engineering team receives the following error message when the reports fail to load: “The SQL query failed while running.”
The data engineering team wants to debug the issue and find queries that cause more than one failure.
When the authors have new book releases, there is often an increase in sales activity. This increase slows the data ingestion process.
The company’s sales team reports that during the last month, the sales data has NOT been up-to-date when they arrive at work in the morning.
Requirements. Planned Changes -
Litware recently signed a contract to receive book reviews. The provider of the reviews exposes the data in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets.
Litware plans to manage Search Engine Optimization (SEO) for the authors. The SEO data will be streamed from a REST API.
Requirements. Version Control -
Litware plans to implement a version control solution in Fabric that will use GitHub integration and follow the principle of least privilege.
Requirements. Governance Requirements
To control data platform costs, the data platform must use only Fabric services and items. Additional Azure resources must NOT be provisioned.
Requirements. Data Requirements -
Litware identifies the following data requirements:
• Process the SEO data in near-real-time (NRT).
• Make the book reviews available in the lakehouse without making a copy of the data.
• When a new book cover image arrives in the Files folder, process the image as soon as possible.
You need to create a workflow for the new book cover images.
Which two components should you include in the workflow? Each correct answer presents part of the solution.
NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.
A. a time-based schedule

Overview. Company Overview -
Contoso, Ltd. is an online retail company that wants to modernize its analytics platform by moving to Fabric. The company plans to begin using Fabric for marketing analytics.
Overview. IT Structure -
The company’s IT department has a team of data analysts and a team of data engineers that use analytics systems.
The data engineers perform the ingestion, transformation, and loading of data. They prefer to use Python or SQL to transform the data.
The data analysts query data and create semantic models and reports. They are qualified to write queries in Power Query and T-SQL.
Existing Environment. Fabric -
Contoso has an F64 capacity named Cap1. All Fabric users are allowed to create items.
Contoso has two workspaces named WorkspaceA and WorkspaceB that currently use Pro license mode.

• Lakehouse2: Will serve data in a dimensional model to users for analytical queries
Additional items will be added to facilitate data ingestion and transformation.
Contoso plans to use Azure Repos for source control in Fabric.
Requirements. Technical Requirements
The new lakehouses must follow a medallion architecture by using the following three layers: bronze, silver, and gold. There will be extensive data cleansing required to populate the MAR1 data in the silver layer, including deduplication, the handling of missing values, and the standardizing of capitalization.
Each layer must be fully populated before moving on to the next layer. If any step in populating the lakehouses fails, an email must be sent to the data engineers.
Data imports must run simultaneously, when possible.
The use of email data from the Amazon S3 bucket must meet the following requirements:
• Minimize egress costs associated with cross-cloud data access.
• Prevent saving a copy of the raw data in the lakehouses.
Items that relate to data ingestion must meet the following requirements:
• The items must be source controlled alongside other workspace items.
• Ingested data must land in the bronze layer of Lakehouse1 in the Delta format.
• No changes other than changes to the file formats must be implemented before the data lands in the bronze layer.
• Development effort must be minimized and a built-in connection must be used to import the source data.
• In the event of a connectivity error, the ingestion processes must attempt the connection again.
Lakehouses, data pipelines, and notebooks must be stored in WorkspaceA. Semantic models, reports, and dataflows must be stored in WorkspaceB.
Once a week, old files that are no longer referenced by a Delta table log must be removed.
Requirements. Data Transformation
In the POS1 product data, ProductID values are unique. The product dimension in the gold layer must include only active products from product list. Active products are identified by an IsActive value of 1.
Some product categories and subcategories are NOT assigned to any product. They are NOT analytically relevant and must be omitted from the product dimension in the gold layer.
Requirements. Data Security -
Security in Fabric must meet the following requirements:
• The data engineers must have read and write access to all the lakehouses, including the underlying files.
• The data analysts must only have read access to the Delta tables in the gold layer.
• The data analysts must NOT have access to the data in the bronze and silver layers.
• The data engineers must be able to commit changes to source control in WorkspaceA.
You need to recommend a solution to resolve the MAR1 connectivity issues. The solution must minimize development effort.
What should you recommend?

Overview -
Litware, Inc. is a publishing company that has an online bookstore and several retail bookstores worldwide. Litware also manages an online advertising business for the authors it represents.
Existing Environment. Fabric Environment
Litware has a Fabric workspace named Workspace1. High concurrency is enabled for Workspace1.
The company has a data engineering team that uses Python for data processing.
Existing Environment. Data Processing
The retail bookstores send sales data at the end of each business day, while the online bookstore constantly provides logs and sales data to a central enterprise resource planning (ERP) system.
Litware implements a medallion architecture by using the following three layers: bronze, silver, and gold. The sales data is ingested from the ERP system as Parquet files that land in the Files folder in a lakehouse. Notebooks are used to transform the files in a Delta table for the bronze and silver layers. The gold layer is in a warehouse that has V-Order disabled.
Litware has image files of book covers in Azure Blob Storage. The files are loaded into the Files folder.
Existing Environment. Sales Data
Month-end sales data is processed on the first calendar day of each month. Data that is older than one month never changes.
In the source system, the sales data refreshes every six hours starting at midnight each day.
The sales data is captured in a Dataflow Gen1 dataflow. When the dataflow runs, new and historical data is captured. The dataflow captures the following fields of the source:
Sales Date -
Author -
Price -
Units -
SKU -
A table named AuthorSales stores the sales data that relates to each author. The table contains a column named AuthorEmail. Authors authenticate to a guest Fabric tenant by using their email address.
Existing Environment. Security Groups
Litware has the following security groups:
Sales -
Fabric Admins -
Streaming Admins -
Existing Environment. Performance Issues
Business users perform ad-hoc queries against the warehouse. The business users indicate that reports against the warehouse sometimes run for two hours and fail to load as expected. Upon further investigation, the data engineering team receives the following error message when the reports fail to load: “The SQL query failed while running.”
The data engineering team wants to debug the issue and find queries that cause more than one failure.
When the authors have new book releases, there is often an increase in sales activity. This increase slows the data ingestion process.
The company’s sales team reports that during the last month, the sales data has NOT been up-to-date when they arrive at work in the morning.
Requirements. Planned Changes -
Litware recently signed a contract to receive book reviews. The provider of the reviews exposes the data in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets.
Litware plans to manage Search Engine Optimization (SEO) for the authors. The SEO data will be streamed from a REST API.
Requirements. Version Control -
Litware plans to implement a version control solution in Fabric that will use GitHub integration and follow the principle of least privilege.
Requirements. Governance Requirements
To control data platform costs, the data platform must use only Fabric services and items. Additional Azure resources must NOT be provisioned.
Requirements. Data Requirements -
Litware identifies the following data requirements:
Process the SEO data in near-real-time (NRT).
Make the book reviews available in the lakehouse without making a copy of the data.
When a new book cover image arrives in the Files folder, process the image as soon as possible.
You need to troubleshoot the ad-hoc query issue.
How should you complete the statement? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.

Overview -
Litware, Inc. is a publishing company that has an online bookstore and several retail bookstores worldwide. Litware also manages an online advertising business for the authors it represents.
Existing Environment. Fabric Environment
Litware has a Fabric workspace named Workspace1. High concurrency is enabled for Workspace1.
The company has a data engineering team that uses Python for data processing.
Existing Environment. Data Processing
The retail bookstores send sales data at the end of each business day, while the online bookstore constantly provides logs and sales data to a central enterprise resource planning (ERP) system.
Litware implements a medallion architecture by using the following three layers: bronze, silver, and gold. The sales data is ingested from the ERP system as Parquet files that land in the Files folder in a lakehouse. Notebooks are used to transform the files in a Delta table for the bronze and silver layers. The gold layer is in a warehouse that has V-Order disabled.
Litware has image files of book covers in Azure Blob Storage. The files are loaded into the Files folder.
Existing Environment. Sales Data
Month-end sales data is processed on the first calendar day of each month. Data that is older than one month never changes.
In the source system, the sales data refreshes every six hours starting at midnight each day.
The sales data is captured in a Dataflow Gen1 dataflow. When the dataflow runs, new and historical data is captured. The dataflow captures the following fields of the source:
• Sales Date
• Author
• Price
• Units
• SKU
A table named AuthorSales stores the sales data that relates to each author. The table contains a column named AuthorEmail. Authors authenticate to a guest Fabric tenant by using their email address.
Existing Environment. Security Groups
Litware has the following security groups:
• Sales
• Fabric Admins
• Streaming Admins
Existing Environment. Performance Issues
Business users perform ad-hoc queries against the warehouse. The business users indicate that reports against the warehouse sometimes run for two hours and fail to load as expected. Upon further investigation, the data engineering team receives the following error message when the reports fail to load: “The SQL query failed while running.”
The data engineering team wants to debug the issue and find queries that cause more than one failure.
When the authors have new book releases, there is often an increase in sales activity. This increase slows the data ingestion process.
The company’s sales team reports that during the last month, the sales data has NOT been up-to-date when they arrive at work in the morning.
Requirements. Planned Changes -
Litware recently signed a contract to receive book reviews. The provider of the reviews exposes the data in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets.
Litware plans to manage Search Engine Optimization (SEO) for the authors. The SEO data will be streamed from a REST API.
Requirements. Version Control -
Litware plans to implement a version control solution in Fabric that will use GitHub integration and follow the principle of least privilege.
Requirements. Governance Requirements
To control data platform costs, the data platform must use only Fabric services and items. Additional Azure resources must NOT be provisioned.
Requirements. Data Requirements -
Litware identifies the following data requirements:
• Process the SEO data in near-real-time (NRT).
• Make the book reviews available in the lakehouse without making a copy of the data.
• When a new book cover image arrives in the Files folder, process the image as soon as possible.
What should you do to optimize the query experience for the business users?
A. Enable V-Order.
B. Create and update statistics.
C. Run the VACUUM command.
D. Introduce primary keys.
