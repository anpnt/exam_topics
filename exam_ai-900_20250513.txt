I think the answer is text extraction

Since the goal is to extract the vehicle registration numbers from the CCTV footage, text extraction using OCR algorithms would be the most appropriate choice. OCR algorithms can recognize and extract text information from images, making it possible to retrieve the registration numbers from the captured video frames. This enables automated monitoring and analysis of the traffic data by extracting the relevant textual information.

Which Azure Cognitive Services service should you use?
A. Form Recognizer
B. Custom Vision
C. Language
D. Computer Vision

Highly Voted comment found!
According to Microsoft's documentation, you can use Custom Vision to label a collection of your personal digital photographs ¹. With Custom Vision, you can upload your own images and labels, and train a model to recognize specific objects or patterns [^web page^]. You can also use Smart Labeler to generate suggested tags for images, which lets you label a large number of images more quickly when you're training a Custom Vision model ¹.

Exam AI-900 topic 1 question 161 discussion
You are developing a system to predict the prices of insurance for drivers in the United Kingdom.
You need to minimize bias in the system.
What should you do?
A. Remove information about protected characteristics from the data before sampling.
B. Take a training sample that is representative of the population in the United Kingdom.
C. Create a training dataset that uses data from global insurers.
D. Take a completely random training sample.

Highly Voted comment found!
B. Take a training sample that is representative of the population in the United Kingdom.

To minimize bias in the system, it's important that your training data is representative of the population you're modeling. This helps ensure that the model's predictions are valid for the full range of drivers in the United Kingdom.

While option A (Remove information about protected characteristics from the data before sampling) could help in some cases to reduce direct discrimination, it might not be sufficient to minimize all types of biases, as some of these characteristics might be indirectly encoded in the remaining features.

Option C (Create a training dataset that uses data from global insurers) may introduce more bias since driving conditions, laws, and demographics vary greatly by country.

Option D (Take a completely random training sample) could still introduce bias if the original data pool is not representative of the population you're interested in.
******************************
Highly Voted comment found!
I think correct answer is B.
To minimize bias in the system, it is important to ensure that the training sample used is representative of the population in the United Kingdom. By including a diverse range of data that accurately reflects the population, you can reduce bias that may arise from underrepresentation or overrepresentation of certain groups. This approach helps to ensure fairness and avoids discriminatory practices in the prediction of insurance prices. Removing information about protected characteristics (option A) may help in some cases, but it is not sufficient on its own to address bias. Options C and D do not specifically address the need for representative sampling. (Chat GPT)

D. After you test a model on the validation data.

Highly Voted comment found!
D is the answer.

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/use-automated-machine-learning/5-machine-learning-steps
You can think of the steps in a machine learning process as:
- Prepare data: Identify the features and label in a dataset. Pre-process, or clean and transform, the data as needed.
- Train model: Split the data into two groups, a training and a validation set. Train a machine learning model using the training data set. Test the machine learning model for performance using the validation data set.
- Evaluate performance: Compare how close the model's predictions are to the known labels.
- Deploy a predictive service: After you train a machine learning model, you can deploy the model as an application on a server or device so that others can use it.

C. Answer questions from multiple users simultaneously.

The tasks like A (Register customer purchases), B (Register customer complaints), and D (Provide customers with return materials authorization (RMA) numbers) would typically require transactional capabilities and potentially integration with the company's back-end systems. The bot would need additional skills or APIs to interact with these systems and execute these tasks effectively. On the other hand, answering questions from multiple users simultaneously is a task that can be accomplished with a bot built on a knowledge base, as it simply entails retrieving and providing information already contained within the knowledge base.

Chitchat is correct. You can choose between different personas.

Correct answer. Adding chit-chat functionality to the bot involves including pre-built conversational responses for general small talk or non-FAQ related interactions. Chit-chat responses can enhance the user experience by providing friendly greetings, acknowledgments, and appropriate responses to casual or non-specific queries.

Options A and B are not directly related to adding greetings and other user-friendly responses. Option C, creating multi-turn questions, refers to handling conversations with multiple interrelated questions and responses. While it can contribute to a more interactive experience, it does not address the specific requirement of adding professional greetings and other user-friendly responses

You are authoring a Language Understanding (LUIS) application to support a music festival.
You want users to be able to ask questions about scheduled shows, such as: `Which act is playing on the main stage?`
The question `Which act is playing on the main stage?` is an example of which type of element?
A. an intent
B. an utterance
C. a domain
D. an entity

Highly Voted comment found!
Correct answer. In the context of a Language Understanding (LUIS) application, an utterance refers to a specific user input or query. It represents a single sentence or phrase that users provide to interact with the application.
In this case, the utterance "Which act is playing on the main stage?" represents a user's question about the scheduled shows at the music festival. By collecting and annotating a variety of utterances like this, the LUIS application can learn to understand user intents and extract relevant entities from the input.
To further clarify the other options:

- An intent represents the purpose or goal behind a user's utterance. It captures the user's intention or desired action.
- A domain refers to a specific area or topic of knowledge, such as music, sports, or weather.
- An entity represents a specific piece of information or data within an utterance. In this case, an entity could be "main stage," which refers to a specific stage at the music festival.

Therefore, the correct answer is B. an utterance.

Microsoft Azure provides multiple cognitive services that you can use to detect and analyze faces, including:

    **Computer Vision, which offers face detection and some basic face analysis, such as determining age.
    **Video Indexer, which you can use to detect and identify faces in a video.
    **Face, which offers pre-built algorithms that can detect, recognize, and analyze faces.

Of these, Face offers the widest range of facial analysis capabilities, so we'll focus on that service in this module.

------------------
The ability to extract text from images is handled by the Computer Vision service, which also provides image analysis capabilities.
The Computer Vision service provides two application programming interfaces (APIs) that you can use to read text in images: the OCR API and the Read API.

Object detection vs. image classification
Image classification is a machine learning based form of computer vision in which a model is trained to categorize images based on the primary subject matter they contain. Object detection goes further than this to classify individual objects within the image, and to return the coordinates of a bounding box that indicates the object's location.

Notice that an object detection model returns the following information:
•	The class of each object identified in the image.
•	The probability score of the object classification (which you can interpret as the confidence of the predicted class being correct)
•	The coordinates of a bounding box for each object.

~Face verification:
The Verify API does an authentication against two detected faces or from one detected face to one person object. Practically, it evaluates whether two faces belong to the same person.

~Person identification:
The Identify API is used to identify a detected face against a database of people (facial recognition search). This feature might be useful for automatic image tagging in photo management software. You create the database in advance, and you can edit it over time.

Confidence is the right answer bitches
******************************
Highly Voted comment found!
Given answer is wrong. The calculated probability of a correct image classification is typically referred to as "confidence."

Confidence represents the level of certainty or probability assigned to a specific classification prediction made by a machine learning model. It indicates the model's belief in the accuracy of its prediction. For example, if a model classifies an image as a dog with a confidence of 0.85, it means the model is 85% confident that the image is correctly classified as a dog.

On the other hand, accuracy is a metric that measures the overall correctness of the model's predictions. It represents the ratio of correct predictions to the total number of predictions made by the model. Accuracy alone does not provide information about the level of confidence or certainty for individual predictions.

This is an example of which type of machine learning?
A. clustering
B. regression
C. classification

Highly Voted comment found!
the brain haemorrhage types are predefined (labeled), so it's classification
******************************
Highly Voted comment found!
This is classification. There are multiple reasons it's classification
- The training data is already tagged as with the correct type of hemorrhage
- Classification can be done for more than two classes (which people seem to not realize based on the comments)
- You do clustering on a group of inputs. For example, the scans of 10 people. You can't cluster a single input. Clearly you get a new scan of a new patient and you want to know what that scan shows, you don't have a group of scans to cluster.
- Clustering gives NO labels. You just get groups and don't know what the label is, but in this question it's very clear they want to know the label that belongs to the new scan -> classification

Correct:
To perform real-time inferencing, you must deploy a pipeline as a real-time endpoint. The real-time endpoint creates an interface between an external application and your scoring model. A call to a real-time endpoint returns prediction results to the application in real-time. To make a call to a real-time endpoint, you pass the API key that was created when you deployed the endpoint. The endpoint is based on REST, a popular architecture choice for web programming projects.

Real-time endpoints must be deployed to an Azure Kubernetes Service cluster.

Regression is a form of machine learning used to understand the relationships between variables to predict a desired outcome. Regression predicts a numeric label or outcome based on variables, or features. For example, an automobile sales company might use the characteristics of a car (such as engine size, number of seats, mileage, and so on) to predict its likely selling price. In this case, the characteristics of the car are the features, and the selling price is the label.

1. object detection

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/computer-vision/concept-object-detection
Object detection is similar to tagging, but the API returns the bounding box coordinates (in pixels) for each object found in the image. For example, if an image contains a dog, cat and person, the Detect operation will list those objects with their coordinates in the image. You can use this functionality to process the relationships between the objects in an image. It also lets you determine whether there are multiple instances of the same object in an image.

OCR or Optical Character Recognition is also referred to as text recognition or text extraction. Machine-learning based OCR techniques allow you to extract printed or handwritten text from images, such as posters, street signs and product labels, as well as from documents like articles, reports, forms, and invoices. The text is typically extracted as words, text lines, and paragraphs or text blocks, enabling access to digital version of the scanned text. This eliminates or significantly reduces the need for manual data entry.

The Microsoft transparency principle for responsible AI requires that AI systems are understandable by users and operators. Therefore, the task that directly aligns with this principle is:

D. Ensure that a training dataset is representative of the population. This helps to ensure that the AI system’s decisions are fair and unbiased, which is a key aspect of transparency.
Option A, while important for accessibility, does not directly relate to the transparency of an AI system. Option B is more about the performance and scalability of the system, and option C, while important for maintainability, does not directly contribute to the transparency of the AI system from the user’s perspective. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is D.

Answer is correct.

What is Natural Language Processing?
Natural language processing (NLP) is the area of AI that deals with creating software that understands written and spoken language.

NLP enables you to create software that can:

-Analyze text documents to extract key phrases and recognize entities (such as places, dates, or people).  ie Text Analystics service

-Perform sentiment analysis to determine how positive or negative the language used in a document is. ie Text Analytics service

-Interpret spoken language, and synthesize speech responses. ie Speech service(speech to text and text to speech)

-Automatically translate spoken or written phrases between languages. ie Text service(for text to text translation)/Speech service(for speech to text/speech translation)

Interpret commands and determine appropriate actions. ie Language Understanding(LUIS) service

I think “Reliability and safety” is correct option as per the following:

“To build trust, it's critical that AI systems operate reliably, safely, and consistently under normal circumstances and in unexpected conditions. These systems should be able to operate as they were originally designed, respond safely to unanticipated conditions, and resist harmful manipulation. It's also important to be able to verify that these systems are behaving as intended under actual operating conditions. How they behave and the variety of conditions they can handle reliably and safely largely reflects the range of situations and circumstances that developers anticipate during design and testing.
We believe that rigorous testing is essential during system development and deployment to ensure AI systems can respond safely in unanticipated situations and edge cases, don't have unexpected performance failures, and don't evolve in ways that are inconsistent with original expectations”
