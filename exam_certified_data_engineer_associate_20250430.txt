Which of the following describes a scenario in which a data team will want to utilize cluster pools?
A. An automated report needs to be refreshed as quickly as possible.
B. An automated report needs to be made reproducible.
C. An automated report needs to be tested to identify errors.
D. An automated report needs to be version-controlled across multiple collaborators.
E. An automated report needs to be runnable by all stakeholders.

Highly Voted comment found!
Using cluster pools reduces the cluster startup time. So in this case, the reports can be refreshed quickly and not having to wait long for the cluster to start
******************************
Highly Voted comment found!
Cluster pools are used in Databricks to reduce the time needed to create and scale clusters by maintaining a set of pre-configured, ready-to-use instances. When an automated report needs to be refreshed quickly, cluster pools help by minimizing cluster startup time, allowing the report generation process to start almost immediately. This is especially beneficial in scenarios where low latency is required to ensure data is updated in near real-time.

The other options (B, C, D, and E) do not directly benefit from the use of cluster pools, as they involve aspects like reproducibility, testing, version control, and stakeholder access, which are not specifically addressed by the primary function of cluster pools.

Which of the following is hosted completely in the control plane of the classic Databricks architecture?
A. Worker node
B. JDBC data source
C. Databricks web application
D. Databricks Filesystem
E. Driver node

Highly Voted comment found!
C. Databricks web application

In the classic Databricks architecture, the control plane includes components like the Databricks web application, the Databricks REST API, and the Databricks Workspace. These components are responsible for managing and controlling the Databricks environment, including cluster provisioning, notebook management, access control, and job scheduling.

The other options, such as worker nodes, JDBC data sources, Databricks Filesystem (DBFS), and driver nodes, are typically part of the data plane or the execution environment, which is separate from the control plane. Worker nodes are responsible for executing tasks and computations, JDBC data sources are used to connect to external databases, DBFS is a distributed file system for data storage, and driver nodes are responsible for coordinating the execution of Spark jobs.

It adds ACID transactions to ensure consistency as multiple parties concurrently read or write data."
******************************
Highly Voted comment found!
B. A data lakehouse supports ACID-compliant transactions.

One of the key features of a data lakehouse that results in improved data quality over a traditional data lake is its support for ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions. ACID transactions provide data integrity and consistency guarantees, ensuring that operations on the data are reliable and that data is not left in an inconsistent state due to failures or concurrent access.

In a traditional data lake, such transactional guarantees are often lacking, making it challenging to maintain data quality, especially in scenarios involving multiple data writes, updates, or complex transformations. A data lakehouse, by offering ACID compliance, helps maintain data quality by providing strong consistency and reliability, which is crucial for data pipelines and analytics.

A data engineer has left the organization. The data team needs to transfer ownership of the data engineer’s Delta tables to a new data engineer. The new data engineer is the lead engineer on the data team.
Assuming the original data engineer no longer has access, which of the following individuals must be the one to transfer ownership of the Delta tables in Data Explorer?
A. Databricks account representative
B. This transfer is not possible
C. Workspace administrator
D. New lead data engineer
E. Original data engineer

Highly Voted comment found!
The ownership of Delta tables in Data Explorer can be transferred by the current owner, a metastore admin, or the owner of the container1. In this case, since the original data engineer no longer has access, the Workspace Administrator (Option C) would be the most appropriate individual to transfer the ownership of the Delta tables to the new data engineer. This is because the Workspace Administrator typically has the necessary permissions to manage such resources2. Please note that the exact process may vary depending on the specific configurations and permissions set up in your workspace. It’s always a good idea to consult with your organization’s IT or data governance team to ensure the correct procedures are followed.

Exam Certified Data Engineer Associate topic 1 question 12 discussion
A data analyst has created a Delta table sales that is used by the entire data analysis team. They want help from the data engineering team to implement a series of tests to ensure the data is clean. However, the data engineering team uses Python for its tests rather than SQL.
Which of the following commands could the data engineering team use to access sales in PySpark?
A. SELECT * FROM sales
B. There is no way to share data between PySpark and SQL.
C. spark.sql("sales")D. spark.delta.table("sales")
E. spark.table("sales")

Highly Voted comment found!
E
The spark.table() function in PySpark allows you to access tables registered in the catalog, including Delta tables. By specifying the table name ("sales"), the data engineering team can read the Delta table and perform various operations on it using PySpark.

Option A, SELECT * FROM sales, is a SQL syntax and cannot be directly used in PySpark.

Option B, "There is no way to share data between PySpark and SQL," is incorrect. PySpark provides the capability to interact with data using both SQL and DataFrame/DataSet APIs.

Option C, spark.sql("sales"), is a valid command to execute SQL queries on registered tables in PySpark. However, in this case, the "sales" argument alone is not a valid SQL query.

Option D, spark.delta.table("sales"), is a specific method provided by Delta Lake to access Delta tables directly. While it can be used to access the "sales" table, it is not the most common approach in PySpark.

A data analyst has a series of queries in a SQL program. The data analyst wants this program to run every day. They only want the final query in the program to run on Sundays. They ask for help from the data engineering team to complete this task.
Which of the following approaches could be used by the data engineering team to complete this task?
A. They could submit a feature request with Databricks to add this functionality.
B. They could wrap the queries using PySpark and use Python’s control flow system to determine when to run the final query.
C. They could only run the entire program on Sundays.
D. They could automatically restrict access to the source table in the final query so that it is only accessible on Sundays.
E. They could redesign the data model to separate the data used in the final query into a new table.

Highly Voted comment found!
B

The answer is B. 

Option A: Submitting a feature request with Databricks to add this functionality is not a feasible solution because it would require Databricks to implement new functionality.

Option C: Only running the entire program on Sundays would be inconvenient for the data analyst because they would have to remember to run the program on Sundays.

Option D: Automatically restricting access to the source table in the final query so that it is only accessible on Sundays would be difficult to implement and would not be a reliable solution.

Option E: Redesigning the data model to separate the data used in the final query into a new table would be a major undertaking and would not be a feasible solution for this specific problem.

Therefore, the only feasible solution to the problem is to wrap the queries using PySpark and use Python's control flow system to determine when to run the final query.

Highly Voted comment found!
The correct control flow statement to begin the conditionally executed code block would be D. if day_of_week == 1 and review_period:.

This statement will check if the variable day_of_week is equal to 1 and if the variable review_period evaluates to a truthy value. The use of the double equal sign (==) in the comparison of day_of_week is important, as a single equal sign (=) would be used to assign a value to the variable instead of checking its value. The use of a single ampersand (&) instead of the keyword and is not valid syntax in Python. The use of quotes around True in options B and C will result in a string comparison, which will not evaluate to True even if the value of review_period is True.

B. All datasets will be updated once and the pipeline will persist without any processing. The compute resources will persist but go unused.
C. All datasets will be updated at set intervals until the pipeline is shut down. The compute resources will be deployed for the update and terminated when the pipeline is stopped.
D. All datasets will be updated once and the pipeline will shut down. The compute resources will be terminated.
E. All datasets will be updated once and the pipeline will shut down. The compute resources will persist to allow for additional testing.

Highly Voted comment found!
C. All datasets will be updated at set intervals until the pipeline is shut down. The compute resources will be deployed for the update and terminated when the pipeline is stopped.

Explanation:

Continuous Pipeline Mode in Production mode implies that the pipeline continuously processes incoming data updates at set intervals, ensuring the datasets are kept up-to-date as new data arrives.
Since the pipeline is set to Continuous Pipeline Mode, it will keep running and updating the datasets until it is manually shut down.
The compute resources are allocated dynamically to process and update the datasets as needed, and they will be terminated when the pipeline is stopped or shut down.
This mode allows for real-time or near-real-time updates to the datasets from the streaming/live tables, ensuring that the data remains current and reflects the changes occurring in the data sources.

A. Gold tables are more likely to contain aggregations than Silver tables.

In some data processing pipelines, especially those following a typical "Bronze-Silver-Gold" data lakehouse architecture, Silver tables are often considered a more refined version of the raw or Bronze data. Silver tables may include data cleansing, schema enforcement, and some initial transformations.

Gold tables, on the other hand, typically represent a stage where data is further enriched, aggregated, and processed to provide valuable insights for analytical purposes. This could indeed involve more aggregations compared to Silver tables.

The correct line of code to fill in the blank to execute a micro-batch to process data every 5 seconds is:

D. trigger(processingTime="5 seconds")

Option A ("trigger("5 seconds")") would not work because it does not specify that the trigger should be a processing time trigger, which is necessary to trigger a micro-batch processing at regular intervals.

Option B ("trigger()") would not work because it would use the default trigger, which is not a processing time trigger.

Option C ("trigger(once="5 seconds")") would not work because it would only trigger the query once, not at regular intervals.

Option E ("trigger(continuous="5 seconds")") would not work because it would trigger the query to run continuously, without any pauses in between, which is not what the data engineer wants.

I am simply appalled by the number of wrong answers in this series of questions. The statement in the question already says "ON VIOLATE DROP ROW" which means if condition is violated, there will be nothing saved to quarantine table and a log of all invalid entries will be recoded. All invalid data that doesn't meet condition will be dropped. 
So C is the correct answer.

E. CREATE STREAMING LIVE TABLE should be used when the previous step in the DLT pipeline is static.

Highly Voted comment found!
B. CREATE STREAMING LIVE TABLE should be used when data needs to be processed incrementally. The CREATE STREAMING LIVE TABLE syntax is used to create tables that read data incrementally, while the CREATE LIVE TABLE syntax is used to create tables that read data in batch mode. Delta Live Tables support both streaming and batch modes of processing data. When the data is streamed and needs to be processed incrementally, CREATE STREAMING LIVE TABLE should be used.

The query scheduler only gives the option on what the interval is to run the query. It does not provide a way to stop after x iterations or at a point in time. 
The question is confusing. From what i found the only option is to limit users access to the query (and therefore query scheduler). 
https://docs.databricks.com/security/auth-authz/access-control/query-acl.html
Not convinced how this would be helping the organization save money if no-one is manually stopping the schedule. 
Answer C seems most correct
Answer D can be achieved using acl however how is this helpful in the use case described?

A data engineer wants to schedule their Databricks SQL dashboard to refresh once per day, but they only want the associated SQL endpoint to be running when it is necessary.
Which of the following approaches can the data engineer use to minimize the total running time of the SQL endpoint used in the refresh schedule of their dashboard?
A. They can ensure the dashboard’s SQL endpoint matches each of the queries’ SQL endpoints.
B. They can set up the dashboard’s SQL endpoint to be serverless.
C. They can turn on the Auto Stop feature for the SQL endpoint.
D. They can reduce the cluster size of the SQL endpoint.
E. They can ensure the dashboard’s SQL endpoint is not one of the included query’s SQL endpoint.

Highly Voted comment found!
The data engineer can use the Auto Stop feature to minimize the total running time of the SQL endpoint used in the refresh schedule of their dashboard. The Auto Stop feature allows the SQL endpoint to automatically shut down when there are no active connections, which will minimize the total running time of the SQL endpoint. By scheduling the dashboard to refresh once per day, the SQL endpoint will only be running for a short period of time each day, which will minimize the total running time and reduce costs.

Monitor alerts are created and used the same way as other Databricks SQL alerts. You create a Databricks SQL query on the monitor profile metrics table or drift metrics table. You then create a Databricks SQL alert for this query. You can configure the alert to evaluate the query at a desired frequency, and send a notification if the alert is triggered. By default, email notification is sent. You can also set up a webhook or send notifications to other applications such as Slack or Pagerduty.

A data engineer has a Job with multiple tasks that runs nightly. Each of the tasks runs slowly because the clusters take a long time to start.
Which of the following actions can the data engineer perform to improve the start up time for the clusters used for the Job?
A. They can use endpoints available in Databricks SQL
B. They can use jobs clusters instead of all-purpose clusters
C. They can configure the clusters to be single-node
D. They can use clusters that are from a cluster pool
E. They can configure the clusters to autoscale for larger data sizes

Highly Voted comment found!
D
Cluster pools are a way to pre-provision clusters that are ready to use. This can reduce the start up time for clusters, as they do not have to be created from scratch.
All-purpose clusters are not pre-provisioned, so they will take longer to start up.
Jobs clusters are a type of cluster pool, but they are not the best option for this use case. Jobs clusters are designed for long-running jobs, and they can be more expensive than other types of cluster pools.
Single-node clusters are the smallest type of cluster, and they will start up the fastest. However, they may not be powerful enough to run the Job's tasks.
Autoscaling clusters can scale up or down based on demand. This can help to improve the start up time for clusters, as they will only be created when they are needed. However, autoscaling clusters can also be more expensive than other types of cluster pool

Ans E : Development and production modes
You can optimize pipeline execution by switching between development and production modes. Use the Delta Live Tables Environment Toggle Icon buttons in the Pipelines UI to switch between these two modes. By default, pipelines run in development mode.

When you run your pipeline in development mode, the Delta Live Tables system does the following:

Reuses a cluster to avoid the overhead of restarts. By default, clusters run for two hours when development mode is enabled. You can change this with the pipelines.clusterShutdown.delay setting in the Configure your compute settings.

Disables pipeline retries so you can immediately detect and fix errors.

In production mode, the Delta Live Tables system does the following:

Restarts the cluster for specific recoverable errors, including memory leaks and stale credentials.

Retries execution in the event of specific errors, for example, a failure to start a cluster.

C. They can increase the cluster size of the SQL endpoint.
D. They can turn on the Serverless feature for the SQL endpoint.
E. They can increase the maximum bound of the SQL endpoint's scaling range.

Highly Voted comment found!
The important point of this scenario is "when they are submitted to a non-running SQL endpoint". So its not about increasing the instance size or the amount of instances to improve the query performance, but its about reducing the start-up time.
A: Not possible, serverless can't be combined with spot instance policies, see https://docs.databricks.com/en/compute/sql-warehouse/serverless.html#limitations
B: Auto Stop is about terminating a SQL warehouse after x minutes of being idle.
C: Increasing the cluster size provides more capacities for running queries, but doesn't reduce start-up time.
D: Serverless reduces start-up time from minutes to seconds. Jackpot!
E: Increasing the max bound of the SQL endpoints scaling range will help with lots of sequencial queries, which is not the case here.
